# DVA Configuration Schema Reference

> Canonical schema: `internal/config/schema.json` — always validate against it.

## Critical Rules (MUST follow)

1. **`plans:` are the current execution model** — Use named plans for new or
   rewritten configs. `modes:` is a migration-only legacy section. `applications:`
   is not legacy but removed: it fails validation, and `dva config migrate`
   converts it to stack entries with `native` runners.
2. **`compose.yml` MUST have `name:`** — Top-level `name: {project}` in compose.yml is required. Without it, `docker compose up` uses the directory name as project, causing port conflicts with DVA's `project_name`.
3. **`version:` field** — Optional, and it declares the **minimum** DVA version the config requires of its reader — not the version of the binary that generated it. Omit it for no compatibility gate. Pinning it to the running CLI version makes every generated config refuse to load on an older DVA. Subproject `version:` is checked against the running DVA independently; it is never compared to root. Canonical source: `internal/config/version.go`.
4. **`health_checks`: `start` and `start_hint` are both optional** — `start` enables DVA auto-start (background process with PID tracking). `start_hint` is human-readable text shown by `dva status` when the service is not ready. If `start` is set, `start_hint` is optional (only needed when the hint text should differ from the start command, e.g., friendlier instructions). If only `start_hint` is set, no auto-start occurs — DVA just displays the hint. Setting both to identical values is redundant and triggers a validation warning.
5. **Port conventions** — Never use common default ports as host ports: 2181, 3000, 3306, 5432, 6379, 8080, 8443, 9090, 9092, 9200, 15672, 27017. Pick a project-specific range instead (e.g. 11100-11199).
6. **`stack:` NOT top-level `compose:`** — Infrastructure compose MUST be declared under `stack.<entry>.runners.compose`.
7. **`runner: local` for host commands** — Interaction commands that run on the host (not inside containers) MUST use `runner: local`. Never wrap host commands in `echo 'Run: ...'`.
8. **Complete reserved command list** — These 26 DVA command names are ALL reserved and MUST NOT appear as plain interaction commands: `up`, `down`, `stop`, `restart`, `build`, `logs`, `status`, `show`, `ls`, `run`, `config`, `doctor`, `provision`, `version`, `console`, `help`, `compose`, `validate`, `manifest`, `kubectl`, `ktl`, `ssh`, `skill`, `completion`, `init`, `agent-deny`. If the project needs a similar function, either use `replace:` hooks (for hookable ones: build/down/logs/restart/stop/up) or rename (e.g., `service-status` instead of `status`, `app-show` instead of `show`). `stack`, `app`, `infra`, and `clean` left this list with the commands themselves (docs/43) and are now ordinary interaction keys. Canonical source: `internal/config/reserved.go`.
9. **Health check URLs: literal values only** — Health check `url:` and `address:` fields must use literal port numbers (e.g., `http://localhost:14000/health`), NOT `${VAR:-DEFAULT}` shell variable patterns. DVA resolves environment separately; shell variables in URLs will not be interpolated.
10. **`stack.<entry>.runners.compose.tags: [infra]`** — The compose-level `tags:` field MUST be present on the primary compose runner. This sets default tags for all services under that entry. Typically `tags: [infra]` for the main infrastructure compose.
11. **Stack compose.files: verify existence** — Every file listed in `stack.{entry}.runners.compose.files` MUST actually exist in the TARGET project. Do NOT assume overlay files exist.
12. **Multi-stack entries: no duplicate base files** — When creating separate stack entries for overlays, each entry should list ONLY its own overlay file(s). Do NOT repeat the base `compose.yml` in every entry. Exception: if an overlay file uses `extends` or `depends_on` referencing base services, include the base but document why.
13. **`services:` is tags-only** — The `services` map under `stack.{entry}.runners.compose` exists ONLY for tag-based filtering. Port information is read from compose.yml at runtime.
14. **`endpoints:` for access metadata** — Use the top-level `endpoints:` section to declare user-facing URLs, labels, tags, and sub-paths. For compose services, use `source: "{service}:{host_port}"` to reference compose ports. For non-compose services, specify `url:` directly.
15. **One stack entry + plans, not multi-stack split** — Do NOT create separate stack entries (e.g., `compose` + `compose-full`) to model different operational configurations. Use ONE stack entry with ALL compose files and control service selection via `plans.*.entries[].services`. Exception: genuinely different infrastructure backends (e.g., compose for local + kubectl for staging).
16. **Single lifecycle owner** — A Compose service is started only by its
    compose stack entry through a plan. Do not also generate a standalone docker
    runner, a raw `docker compose up` interaction, or a provision start step for
    that service. A `docker` runner means standalone `docker run`, not Docker
    Compose. (Removing `applications:` removed the second lifecycle owner this
    rule was mostly written against; the remaining three shapes still collide.)

## dva.yml Structure

**Canonical section order** (omit unused sections, but keep this order):
`version → vars → environment → env_file → stack → plans → default_plan → environments → sites → checks → default_mode → suggestion_ignore → modes → health_checks → interaction → provision → modules → subprojects → endpoints → infra → ssh → devcontainer`

`checks`, `default_mode`, `suggestion_ignore`, and `modes` are legacy-compatible sections. Preserve them only when needed during migration; new configurations should use plans and stack runners.

`applications:` was removed. Declare each app as a stack entry with a `native` runner (see
`stack.api` below) and run `dva config migrate` to convert an existing file. A config that
still carries the key is rejected by `dva config validate`, not merely warned about.

### Endpoints vs Services — When to Use What

| Information | Where it belongs | Example |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| Service tags (filtering) | `stack.<entry>.runners.compose` -> `services` | `postgres: { tags: [infra, data] }` |
| Port labels, URLs | `endpoints` | `db: { source: "postgres:15432", label: "PostgreSQL" }` |
| Sub-paths | `endpoints` | `paths: { /health: "Health check" }` |
| HTTP flag | `endpoints` | Inferred from source port or explicit in url |

**Anti-pattern:** Do NOT create `compose` + `compose-full` as separate stack entries — this duplicates service definitions and compose file references.

## compose.yml Requirements

When generating or modifying `compose.yml`, ensure:

```yaml
# REQUIRED: top-level name must match dva.yml stack.<entry>.runners.compose.project_name
name: myapp

services:
  # ... service definitions ...
```

- **`name:` is mandatory** — prevents directory-name-based project naming conflicts
- Use `compose.yml` (not `docker-compose.yml`) — DVA convention
- No `version:` key — Compose Specification doesn't require it
- All core services should have `healthcheck:` defined
- Use profile-gated services for optional app services: `profiles: ["rust"]`

## Modes & Environments — CLI Flag Reference

### Plan entry profiles (current route)

Select Compose profiles on the plan entry that owns the Compose runner. This is the
current route for named plans and passes each value as a `--profile` flag to Docker
Compose. Service selection and profile selection are independent and can be combined.

```yaml
plans:
  local-dev:
    entries:
      - name: infra
        runner: compose
        services: [db, redis]
        profiles: [tools]
```

### --mode/-M (Modes, legacy)
Selects a named mode from `modes:` section. Determines HOW to run infrastructure.

```bash
dva up --mode native     # Skip compose, health checks only
dva up -M docker         # Legacy mode with compose_profiles
dva up -M hybrid         # Partial compose + health checks
```

**Mode resolution logic (evaluated in order):**
1. If `stack: [entry1]` → run only listed stack entries (selects which stack entries to activate)
2. If `compose_services` omitted (nil) → start all services in compose files
3. If `compose_services: []` (empty list) → skip compose entirely, run health_checks only
4. If `compose_services: [svc1, svc2]` → start only listed services
5. If `compose_profiles: [prof1]` → pass `--profile prof1` to docker compose (legacy)
6. If `environment:` present → merge into compose environment
7. `compose_services` and `compose_profiles` can be combined (both apply independently)

**Single stack + plans pattern (preferred):** Use ONE stack entry with all compose files and control service selection via `plans.*.entries[].services`:
```yaml
stack:
  infra:
    default_runner: compose
    runners:
      compose:
        files: [compose.yml, compose.dev-full.yml]  # All overlays in one entry
        services:
          db:    { tags: [infra] }
          redis: { tags: [infra] }
          app:   { tags: [app] }
plans:
  local-infra:
    entries:
      - name: infra
        runner: compose
        services: [db, redis]
default_mode: infra                      # dva up (no -M) → minimal infra only
modes:
  infra:
    description: "Core infrastructure only (DB + cache)"
    compose_services: [db, redis]       # Start only infra
  full-stack:
    description: "Full dev environment"  # Omit compose_services = start all
```
**`default_mode` (required):** Specifies which mode is applied when `dva up` is called without `--mode/-M`. This ensures `dva up` starts only minimal infrastructure by default. Heavy services (monitoring, Kafka, Redis Sentinel/Cluster, HA setups) must be in explicit modes like `full-stack` or `full-stack-monitoring`. Users run `dva up -M full-stack` when they need everything.

**Anti-pattern:** Do NOT create `compose` + `compose-full` as separate stack entries — this duplicates service definitions and compose file references.

**`suggestion_ignore` (optional):** Array of glob patterns for Makefile/package.json targets to suppress from `config suggestion` warnings. Use when targets are intentionally not mapped to DVA interactions:
```yaml
suggestion_ignore:
  - "*-release"     # CI-only release builds
  - "clippy*"       # covered by lint interaction
  - "test-e2e-*"    # covered by e2e interaction
```

**`compose_profiles` semantics (legacy `modes:` only):**
- `compose_profiles: [rust]` → activate the "rust" profile
- `compose_profiles: []` (empty) → no profiles activated (only default services start)
- Omitted → no `--profile` flag passed (same as empty)

**"All services" mode:** Omit `compose_services` entirely (nil = all). Do NOT use `compose_profiles: []` as a substitute — empty profiles ≠ all services. If a mode should start everything, simply omit both `compose_services` and `compose_profiles`.

**Avoid redundant modes:** Each mode must have a distinct service set. If two modes would start identical services, merge them or differentiate by adding/removing specific services.

**Common mode patterns:**
| Mode Name | compose_services | compose_profiles | health_checks | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| infra-only | [list of infra] | — | — | Infra only, app runs natively |
| full-stack | (omitted = all) | — | — | Everything in Docker |
| full-stack-tools | (omitted = all) | [tools] | — | Everything + dev tools profile |
| hybrid | [list of infra] | — | [api, worker] | Infra in Docker, app natively |
| native | [] (empty) | — | [api, worker] | No Docker, health checks only |
| dev | [minimal infra] | — | [api] | Minimal infra for dev |

### --env/-E (Environments)
Selects a named environment from `environments:` section. Determines WHAT settings to use.

```bash
dva up --env dev         # Development settings
dva up -E stg            # Staging settings
dva up -M native -E stg  # Combined: native mode + staging env
```

**Environment resolution logic:**
1. Lookup name in `environments:` map
2. Merge `environment:` vars into compose context
3. Can combine with `--mode` (both flags applied independently)

## Health Checks — Start & Hint Patterns

When a service runs natively (not in Docker), use `start` and/or `start_hint` depending on the use case:

### Pattern 1: Auto-start only (most common)

```yaml
health_checks:
  api:
    type: http
    url: "http://localhost:11100/health/live"
    start: "cd my-app && cargo run -p api-server"  # DVA auto-starts this
    timeout: 5
    ready_timeout: 120
```

DVA runs the command in background, tracks PID, logs to `.sb/dva/logs/{name}.log`. `dva down` kills PID-tracked processes. When the service is starting, `dva status` shows the log path instead of a hint text. If you want a human-readable hint shown when the service is not ready, add `start_hint` with different text (Pattern 2).

### Pattern 2: Auto-start with different hint text

```yaml
health_checks:
  api:
    type: http
    url: "http://localhost:11100/health/live"
    start: "cd my-app && cargo run -p api-server"
    start_hint: "Run the API server from my-app/"  # Friendlier text for dva status
    timeout: 5
    ready_timeout: 120
```

Use this when you want `dva status` to show a human-friendly message that differs from the actual start command.

### Pattern 3: Hint only (no auto-start)

```yaml
health_checks:
  external-api:
    type: http
    url: "http://localhost:9090/health"
    start_hint: "Start the external API manually: see docs/setup.md"
    timeout: 5
```

No auto-start — DVA only displays the hint text when the service is not ready.

### Rules

- `start` → DVA runs this in background, tracks PID, logs to `.sb/dva/logs/{name}.log`
- `start_hint` → displayed by `dva status` when the service is not ready
- If `start` is set without `start_hint`, no hint text is shown (only log path while starting)
- Setting both to identical values is redundant and triggers a validation warning
- `dva down` automatically kills PID-tracked processes

## Interaction Patterns by Project Type

### Runner Selection Rule

Commands fall into two categories:

| Category | `runner` | `service` | When to use |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Container command** | (omit) | required | Runs INSIDE a compose service (db console, redis-cli) |
| **Host command** | `local` | (omit) | Runs on HOST machine (cargo build, go test, npm test) |

**Anti-pattern:** Never use `echo 'Run: ...'` as a command. If the command runs on the host, use `runner: local`.

### Hybrid Pattern (devbox with native app development)

When infra runs in Docker but the app is built/tested natively on the host:

```yaml
interaction:
  # Container commands — run inside compose services
  db:
    description: "PostgreSQL console"
    service: postgres
    command: psql -U ${POSTGRES_USER:-dev} -d ${POSTGRES_DB:-devdb}
  redis:
    description: "Redis CLI"
    service: redis
    command: redis-cli

  # Host commands — run on the developer's machine
  build:
    replace:
      - step: "Build application"
        run: "make build"
  test:
    description: "Run all tests"
    command: "cargo test"
    runner: local
    tags: [test]
  lint:
    description: "Run linter"
    command: "cargo clippy -- -D warnings"
    runner: local
    tags: [quality]
```

### Go (host build)
```yaml
interaction:
  test:
    description: "Run tests"
    command: "go test ./..."
    runner: local
  build:
    replace:
      - step: "Build binary"
        run: "make build"
  lint:
    description: "Run linters"
    command: "golangci-lint run"
    runner: local
```

### Go (container build)
```yaml
interaction:
  shell:
    description: "Open shell in app container"
    service: app
    command: /bin/bash
  test:
    description: "Run tests"
    service: app
    command: go test ./...
  build:
    description: "Build binary"
    service: app
    command: make build
```

### Rust (host build — typical for devbox pattern)
```yaml
interaction:
  test:
    description: "Run all tests"
    command: "cargo test"
    runner: local
    tags: [test]
    subcommands:
      unit:
        description: "Unit tests only"
        command: "cargo test --lib"
        runner: local
      integration:
        description: "Integration tests (requires Docker)"
        command: "cargo test --test '*' -- --test-threads=1"
        runner: local
  build:
    replace:
      - step: "Build release binaries"
        run: "cargo build --release"
  lint:
    description: "Run clippy"
    command: "cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings"
    runner: local
    tags: [quality]
  fmt:
    description: "Format code"
    command: "cargo fmt"
    runner: local
    tags: [quality]
  check:
    description: "Type-check without building"
    command: "cargo check"
    runner: local
    tags: [quality]
```

### Python
```yaml
interaction:
  shell:
    description: "Open shell"
    service: app
    command: /bin/bash
  test:
    description: "Run tests"
    service: app
    command: uv run pytest
  migrate:
    description: "Run database migrations"
    service: app
    command: uv run python manage.py migrate
```

### Node.js
```yaml
interaction:
  shell:
    description: "Open shell"
    service: app
    command: /bin/sh
  test:
    description: "Run tests"
    service: app
    command: pnpm test
  dev:
    description: "Start dev server"
    service: app
    command: pnpm dev
```

### Ruby/Rails
```yaml
interaction:
  shell:
    description: "Open shell"
    service: app
    command: /bin/bash
  rails-console:
    description: "Rails console"
    service: app
    command: bundle exec rails console
  test:
    description: "Run tests"
    service: app
    command: bundle exec rspec
```

### Database Services
```yaml
interaction:
  db:
    description: "PostgreSQL console"
    service: postgres
    command: psql -U ${POSTGRES_USER:-dev} -d ${POSTGRES_DB:-devdb}
  redis:
    description: "Redis CLI"
    service: redis
    command: redis-cli
```

## Invalid Field Reference

The following fields are NOT valid in dva.yml. Use the correct equivalents:

| Invalid Field | Correct Equivalent | Notes |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------|
| `host_command: "cmd"` | `command: "cmd"` + `runner: local` | Host commands use `runner: local` |
| `compose_up: { tags: [infra] }` | `modes:` section | Tag-based service selection belongs in modes. Resolve tags to explicit service names. |
| `compose_logs: { services: [svc], follow: true }` | `command: "docker compose logs -f svc"` + `runner: local` | For reserved `logs` command, use `replace:` hook instead |
| `endpoints: [...]` in interaction | Top-level `endpoints:` section | Use named-keys format: `{name}: { url: ..., label: ... }` |
| `echo 'Run: ...'` as command | Actual command + `runner: local` | Always execute, never just echo instructions |
| `service: local` | `runner: local` (no `service:`) | Host commands use `runner: local`, not `service: local` |
| `shell: true` (on host commands) | `runner: local` (no `shell: true`) | `runner: local` already executes via shell. Keep `shell: true` only for container commands needing shell interpolation |
| `profiles:` outside a plan entry | `plans.<plan>.entries[].profiles` | Select Compose profiles on the plan entry that owns the Compose runner. `modes.*.compose_profiles` is the legacy migration-only shape. |
| top-level `compose:` or `stack.<entry>.compose` | `stack.<entry>.runners.compose` | Use named runners |
| `lifecycle:` | `stack:` | Use `stack:` |

### Subproject Consistency

Imported or directly executed subproject dva.yml files MUST follow the same rules as the root:
- `version:` is optional and is **not** compared to root — DVA checks each file's floor
  against the running binary independently, so do not require the two to agree
- Same format rules apply (stack, runner:local, no echo wrappers)
- Declared-only subprojects without import entries (`import` omitted or `import: {}`) may be initialized later

### Provision Step Fields

`compose_up:`, `compose_exec:`, and `compose_run:` are valid provision step fields for direct
Compose subcommands. The command portions of `compose_exec:` and `compose_run:` are tokenized
with the same quote-aware rule as `run:` with `shell: false`; for example,
`compose_exec: "web sh -c 'echo a b'"` passes `echo a b` as one argument.

These fields and `run:` are not interchangeable: compose fields select a Compose subcommand,
while `run:` follows the configured runner. Use the field that expresses the intended execution
path rather than translating one form into the other.

### env_file Format

```yaml
env_file:
  files:
    - path: .env.example
      required: true
    - path: .env
      required: false
```

### Commonly Misused Fields

These fields ARE valid but are frequently used incorrectly:

- **`shell: true`** — Valid. Enables shell interpolation for multi-line or piped commands. Use when command contains `&&`, `||`, `|`, or shell variables.
- **`compose: { method: "up", profiles: [] }`** — Valid. Controls how DVA invokes docker compose for this command.
- **`environment:`** in interaction — Valid. Per-command environment variable overrides. On the
  compose path these reach the **container**: DVA injects the merged declared environment as
  `-e KEY=VALUE` on every compose subcommand that accepts it (`run`, `exec`, including `steps:`
  which always builds `exec`). `up` — the method used when `profiles:` is configured — has no
  `-e` flag and is excluded, as is kubectl (`kubectl exec` has no env flag). What crosses is the
  whole merged variable set — `env_file`, global `vars`, `environment:`, site vars, plan vars,
  `--var`, and the command's own `environment:` — but only keys that were declared somewhere:
  an OS value overrides a declared key, it does not add one, so undeclared host variables stay
  out. `DVA_*` is excluded. A declared key overrides the image's own value — declaring `PATH`
  replaces the container's `PATH` on exec.

## Validation

```bash
# Validate using DVA CLI
dva validate

# Validate specific file
DVA_FILE=path/to/dva.yml dva validate

# Validate against schema directly
# Schema location: internal/config/schema.json
```

## Lifecycle CLI Commands

There is one lifecycle surface, and a plan name is how you aim it. `dva stack`, `dva app`,
`dva infra`, and `dva clean` were removed in docs/43 — the same verb no longer means three
different things depending on which noun preceded it.

Bare `dva up` uses `default_plan`, or the only plan as an implicit default. With no `plans:`
it starts every declared stack entry; with several plans and no `default_plan` it refuses.

```bash
dva up                    # Start the no-name selection described above
dva up web                # Start the plan named `web`
dva up web --no-wait      # Skip readiness waiting
dva up web --force        # Proceed past a failing precondition
dva up web --var KEY=val  # Override a plan variable
dva stop web              # Stop, preserving state for a fast restart
dva down web              # Tear down
dva down web --volumes    # Also remove volumes
dva down web --purge      # Remove volumes, images, and provision markers (replaces `dva clean`)
dva restart web           # Stop then start
dva build web             # Build the plan's entries (native `build:` and compose builds)
dva logs web              # Tail the plan's entries
dva status                # Show entry statuses
```

Every one of these runs the `interaction:` hooks (before/replace/after) for its command name
where the command is hookable, then delegates to the orchestrator. Entries run in `order:`
sequence, with tag filtering (`--tags`/`-T`, `--exclude-tag`) and mode filtering (`-M`)
applying throughout. Exports from earlier entries reach later ones via environment
accumulation.

**Stop vs down:** `stop` sends SIGTERM and leaves PID and log files in place, so the next
`up` is a fast restart. `down` tears the resources down; `--purge` additionally removes
volumes, images, and provision markers, and prompts before doing so unless `--force` is
given.

`--purge` is a flag rather than a `clean` command, which means it has no `interaction:` key
to hang a hook on. A config that had `interaction.clean.before` must move that step
elsewhere — `dva config validate` names the removal rather than silently reinterpreting the
key as a standalone command.

### Typical Development Flow

```bash
dva up                   # 1. Start the default plan (infra + apps together)
# ... develop ...
dva restart web          # 2. Restart after changes
dva logs web             # 3. Watch output
dva down web --purge     # 4. Full teardown including volumes and markers
```
