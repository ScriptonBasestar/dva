# DVA (Dev Virtual Auto) CLI

DVA is a development workspace orchestrator that unifies Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Helm, and local processes through a single `dva.yml` configuration. All CLI tasks for building, testing, running, and managing development infrastructure go through DVA.

## Rules (Mandatory)

- **Use DVA for declared workflows.** Raw tools are allowed for read-only
  validation (`docker compose ... config`) or when no DVA command exists; state why.
- **NEVER parse `dva.yml` manually.** Use `dva manifest -f json` for structured command discovery or `dva config show` for merged configuration output.
- **NEVER guess available commands.** Run `dva ls` or `dva manifest -f json` to discover project-specific commands before execution.
- **Do not trust lifecycle `--dry-run` blindly.** Prove the installed version is
  non-mutating in a disposable fixture before using it with up/down/provision.
- **Prefer `am run dva-improve` for broad configuration rewrites.** For targeted config authoring or migration, start from the bundled templates and validate with `dva config validate`.
- **Use `dva doctor` read-only first.** `--fix` requires explicit authority and
  review of the proposed mutation.

Before lifecycle execution, destructive diagnostics, global installation, or uncertain help/preview
paths, read **`references/operation-safety.md`** and use its authority and disposable-fixture gates.

## Project Context

!`dva show 2>/dev/null || echo "DVA not configured in this project"`

## Available Commands

!`dva ls -f json 2>/dev/null || echo "No dva.yml found"`

## Workflow

### Discover Commands

Before executing any build, test, or run task, discover available commands:

```bash
dva manifest -f json    # LLM-optimized structured output
dva ls                  # human-readable command list
dva ls -f json          # JSON command list with runner info
dva config show -f yaml # merged configuration
```

Read the `dynamic_commands` section from manifest output to identify project-specific commands and their runners (DockerCompose, Kubectl, or Local).

### Author or Migrate Configuration

For deep configuration authoring, migration, and defect attribution (ownership
model, change modes, risk-ordered validation), use the **`dva-config` skill**
(`dva:dva-config`). This section covers only the quick-start surface.

For repeatable `dva.yml` work, load **`references/patterns.md`** first, then choose a template.
Devbox-wide apply (Make/npm → DVA, `.gz-git.yaml` children, infra vs app plans, Compose
scaffold) is **`dva-config` `references/devbox-apply.md`**.

```text
assets/templates/root-devbox-plan.yml       # parent devbox: compose-owned full stack + native dev runners
assets/templates/subproject-local.yml       # child project: local interactions/provision only
assets/templates/migrate-modes-to-plans.yml # old modes/applications -> stack runners + plans
```

Use the declarative structure by default:

```text
stack = reusable declarations
plans = executable names
environments = dev/stg/prd vars
sites = local/office/remote/cloud host differences
interaction = one-shot convenience commands
provision = one-time setup procedures
```

For new/rewrite configuration, use named plans; treat `modes` and
`applications` as migration-only legacy sections. After editing, run:

```bash
dva config validate
dva config validate --strict
dva ls
dva manifest -f json
```

### Execute Commands

For CI profiles, commit/full verification, time budgets, or duplicate AI-session
checks, use the bundled `dva-ci` skill. Discover `ci_profiles` in the manifest;
`dva ci` defaults to `commit`, while `dva ci status` inspects existing runs.

Run project-defined interaction commands directly. The `run` prefix is optional:

```bash
dva test               # = dva run test
dva build              # = dva run build
dva lint               # = dva run lint
dva <command>          # any interaction command from dva.yml
```

For subproject commands in monorepos, use namespace syntax:

```bash
dva api:test           # run test in api subproject
dva run --project api test  # equivalent explicit form
```

Pass additional flags as needed:

```bash
dva run -p 8080:80 web     # port publishing
dva run --dry-run test     # preview execution plan without running
```

### Lifecycle Management

Lifecycle commands execute a named plan whose entries select stack runners,
service subsets, order, and dependencies:

```bash
dva up local-infra      # start the named plan
dva up local-dev        # compose infra + native app runners
dva down local-dev      # reverse-order teardown for the same plan
dva stop local-dev      # stop without removing for the same plan
dva restart local-dev  # stop + start the named plan
dva logs local-dev     # view the plan's entry logs
dva build local-dev    # build the plan's entries
dva down local-dev --volumes  # teardown, also removing volumes
dva down local-dev --purge    # + images and provision markers (data loss warning)
```

Every lifecycle verb takes a plan name in the same slot. `dva stack`, `dva app`, and
`dva clean` were removed — `--purge` on `down` replaces `clean`.

Plans select an `environment` and `site`. Do not create a separate `docker`
runner for a service already owned by a Compose entry: `docker` means a
standalone `docker run` target, while `compose` owns Compose services.

### Diagnostics

```bash
dva doctor             # check environment prerequisites
dva doctor --fix       # mutation; explicit authority required
dva status             # workspace and service status
dva config show        # final merged configuration (JSON)
dva config show -f yaml  # YAML format
dva config validate    # validate dva.yml schema
dva config validate --fix  # auto-fix compose project name
```

### Integration Pass-through

When DVA lacks a direct command for an operation, use pass-through:

```bash
dva compose <args>     # pass-through to docker compose
dva kubectl <args>     # pass-through to kubectl
dva ktl <args>         # compatibility name for kubectl
dva ssh up             # SSH agent container
```

`dva infra` was removed. Shared infrastructure is a stack entry like any other; select it
with a plan and use the lifecycle verbs above.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Plans | Named executable combinations of stack entries and runners. |
| Environments | dev/stg/prd variable differences selected by plans. Names label variable sets, not deployment targets. |
| Sites | local/office/remote/cloud host differences selected by plans. Default to local; go remote only for resources that cannot run locally. |
| Runners | DockerCompose (`service:` key), Kubectl (`pod:` key), Local (default). |
| Subprojects | Monorepo support: `dva namespace:command` or `dva run --project name cmd`. |
| Hooks | `before:`, `after:`, `replace:` on lifecycle commands (up, down, build, etc.). |
| Modules | `.sb/dva/*.yml` files merged into base config. Override with `dva.override.yml`. |
| Dynamic routing | Unknown commands route to `dva run <cmd>` automatically. |
| Applications | Legacy long-running process model; migrate to stack runners + plans. |
| Provision | One-time setup only; lifecycle startup belongs to plans. |

## Global Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--debug` | Enable debug logging |
| `--dry-run` | Preview flag; verify non-mutation for the installed version before lifecycle use. |
| `--json` | JSON output (LLM-optimized) |

## LLM Integration

DVA provides first-class LLM support:

```bash
am run dva-discover        # project analysis and options discovery
am run dva-improve         # AI-based dva.yml generation/improvement
am run dva-diagnose        # AI-based error diagnosis and configuration fix
dva manifest -f json       # structured command manifest for AI
dva config docs            # regenerate AI agent configuration (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md)
dva --json <command>       # JSON output on any command
```
