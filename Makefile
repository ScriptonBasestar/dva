# 2. The CI Test / Integration Test steps set GOMAXPROCS=1 so -race cannot
#    saturate a 2-core hosted runner and starve its heartbeat.

	@# A go binary that disagrees with the GOROOT mise exports makes golangci-lint fail
	@# with "could not import os/strings/..." on every cold analysis, which reads as if
	@# the tree does not compile. Measured: the same binary on the same cold cache
	@# reports 0 issues when run without the wrapper, so the failure is wrapper-specific
	@# rather than a property of the tree. TASK-204.
	@#
	@# The check must resolve go the way golangci-lint does — through PATH, in a
	@# subshell, under the wrapper. `mise exec -- go version` resolves a go passed
	@# directly as its argument through mise's own tool table rather than through the
	@# PATH it constructs, so it reports a MATCHED pair on a machine where the linter is
	@# about to fail; a check written that way could never fire. head -1 is required,
	@# not cosmetic: $$(go env GOROOT)/VERSION is two lines (the version, then a build
	@# timestamp), so comparing it whole against one-line `go version` output would fail
	@# the gate on a correctly paired machine.
	@#
	@# An unreadable pairing must fail, and with its own message. If either substitution
	@# fails it yields the empty string, and two empty strings compare EQUAL — so without
	@# the -z check below a `go` that is missing, or present but exiting non-zero, makes
	@# this guard report health having verified nothing, indistinguishable from a real
	@# match. Measured: a `#!/bin/sh exit 3` stub named go gives tool=[] root=[] rc=0.
	@# That is the failure shape of TASK-205 one level up — hiding the diagnostic rather
	@# than the result — and the same shape the gopls rc check below rejects. Note it
	@# degrades the wrong way if left alone: a PARTIAL failure makes the strings differ
	@# and fires loudly about a mismatch that does not exist, while a TOTAL failure passes
	@# in silence. The reachable case is not an exotic PATH — it is any machine where go
	@# comes only through mise, since `mise exec` reverts toward the pre-activation PATH.
