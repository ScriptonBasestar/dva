// archivePrefix is the frozen zone this guard covers. The property asserted is that every card
// under it carries `id:` or `type:` in its frontmatter. `ce task validate` does not assert that,
// under either build of it — and the two builds fail to assert it for opposite reasons, which is
// why this comment describes both rather than whichever one happens to be installed.
//
// ce has a rule that archived documents are history and are not maintained. Before ce-agent-kit
// 7391ac64 it evaluated that rule last, which left the rule mostly unreachable. Read from source
// at 01e4dc52 (internal/usecase/task/canonical_validator.go, validateCanonicalTask), the order
// was:
//
//  1. parse; "detected" means only that line 1 trimmed is `---`
//  2. YAML error      -> hard error, returns          <- before the skip
//  3. no id, no type  -> falls through to the legacy validator
//  4. canonicalFrozenZone(path) -> "Skipped: archived..."
//
// so a card reaching step 3 was judged as unfinished current work, in a directory named
// `_archive`, against a card format that postdates it. 7391ac64 hoists the zone decision into
// Validator.Validate ahead of both the decision-doc route and validateCanonicalTask, so an
// archived card is exempt before anything reads it. Measured across both binaries: 13 cards the
// old one reported red — 10 with neither field, 3 with malformed YAML — every one of them skips
// under the new one.
//
// Fixed ce therefore does not mis-judge these cards. It also reports nothing whatsoever about
// them, which is the same fact seen from the other side: the property above was only ever
// enforced by ce's incidental red, so once the fix lands it is enforced by nothing but this file
// (TASK-206). "Current ce handles the archive correctly" is not a reason to delete this guard —
// correct-and-silent is the exact condition under which it becomes the only check left.
//
// Three boundaries, each measured, so this guard is not read as more than it is:
//
//   - It asserts field presence only. A card with `id:` and malformed YAML passes here —
//     doccheck is stdlib-only and cannot parse YAML to see it. Pre-fix ce caught that as a
//     step-2 hard error; fixed ce skips it with everything else. So it is an open gap, not a
//     division of labour, and it widens rather than closes when ce is upgraded.
//   - Archived *decision* docs (a path component `decision`/`decisions`/`adr`/`adrs`) are
//     uncovered under both builds: pre-fix, validator.go routed them away before any of this;
//     post-fix, the hoisted zone check exempts them first. That is a path rule, not a
//     frontmatter one, so a frontmatter guard cannot express it — the reason it is absent
//     here, rather than that dva has none.
//   - `ce task validate --all` excludes the archive during its tree walk, so none of this ever
//     fired there — measured, 7 files validated against 200 archived cards on disk. The old
//     misjudgement was reachable only by explicit path, which is how an audit sweep reaches it.

// canonicalFields are the frontmatter keys that satisfy step 3 above. Both are listed because
// it accepts *either* — confirmed against source, where the whole test is a presence lookup for
// "id" then "type" in the parsed frontmatter map, with no third key and no inspection of the
// value. Requiring `id:` alone would reject a card ce classifies correctly, and a gate whose
// verdict disagrees with the tool it exists to protect is the same class of defect as one that
// cannot fire.

// and "no frontmatter block" is simply false about a file that opened one and never closed it.
// ce separates them too: an unopened block falls through to the legacy validator, while an
// unterminated one is a hard `Invalid YAML frontmatter: unterminated frontmatter`.

// inside a ```yaml example. That was a silent false pass one byte wide, found in review.
