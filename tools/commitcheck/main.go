// Command commitcheck: hold this repository's commit subjects to the format SSOT.
//
// The format is declared once, outside this repository, in the ce-agent-kit git skill
// (skills/git/SKILL.md, <commit-format>): `{type}({scope}): {subject}`, six types, scope
// required, subject 50 chars max. Nothing enforced it here, and the corpus drifted in
// exactly the way an unenforced rule drifts -- silently, and only in the dimension that
// is hardest to notice while writing.
//
// Measured over the 679 commits reachable at the point this gate landed:
//
//	<=50 chars    85   (12.5%)
//	51-60        102
//	61-72        249
//	>72          243   (35.8%)
//
// and over the 60 most recent: 3 at <=50, 12 at 51-60, 27 at 61-72, 18 over 72.
//
// That distribution is why the enforced limit here is 72 and not the SSOT's 50. A gate at
// 50 would reject roughly seven of every eight commits this repository has ever written,
// including nearly all of the recent ones written carefully; it would be bypassed or
// deleted within a day, and a deleted gate enforces nothing. 72 is the Conventional
// Commits hard limit and the width at which `git log --oneline` stops wrapping in an
// 80-column terminal, and it rejects 30% of recent subjects -- a real tightening that the
// existing writing habit can actually reach. The SSOT's 50 remains the target to aim at;
// this is the floor below which the build stops. The deviation is deliberate, was chosen
// by the repository owner, and is recorded here rather than left for a reader to discover
// as an inconsistency.
//
// History before the gate is history. baseline pins the commit this gate landed on top
// of, so the 243 subjects already over 72 are not retroactively failures -- the same
// logic the archived task cards get. The range only ever grows from there, so every
// commit written after the gate is checked on every run, forever.
//
// Two SSOT rules are deliberately not enforced, because a gate that fires on correct
// input teaches people to route around it:
//
//   - Imperative mood is not mechanically decidable. "update the parser" and "updates the
//     parser" differ by a suffix that also appears in correct subjects.
//   - Lowercase is decidable but not safely. Measured 0 violations in the last 200
//     subjects, while legitimate subjects begin with an identifier that must keep its
//     case (`DVA`, `TASK-203`, a backticked command). Enforcing it would produce only
//     false positives against this corpus.
//
// The Co-Authored-By trailer is reported but does not fail the build. 10 of the last 60
// commits lack it and all 60 are authored by the same human git identity, so the trailer
// is an agent-attribution rule rather than a repository convention, and this gate cannot
// tell which kind of author it is looking at. Counting it makes a silent omission visible
// without blocking a human's own commit.

// baseline is the commit this gate landed on top of. Commits at or before it predate the
// rule and are not checked; everything after it is. Moving this forward would retire
// findings rather than fix them, so it moves only when history is rewritten under it.

// grandfatheredCommits are the post-baseline commits explicitly waived by this gate. The
// baseline must not move to retire them: every other commit after it remains checked. A
// waiver matches both the immutable object ID and its intended subject, so copying either
// half into a future commit cannot bypass the gate.
//
// A waiver is only ever the right answer for a subject that is already published. Rewriting
// pushed history is forbidden here, so a bad subject that reaches an integration branch can
// no longer be fixed -- it can only be recorded. Every entry therefore carries the reason it
// could not be repaired, and adding one is an admission, not a routine step.
//
// Note what the five 2026-09-03 entries have in common: all five landed on the same day,
// from separate agent sessions, while this gate existed and passed for none of them. That is
// the shape of a check nothing runs before the thing it checks. The commit-msg hook installed
// by `make install-hooks` is the answer to that, and it is why this table should stop growing.
//
// It grew anyway, and the two 2026-09-07 entries say why: in the clone that produced them
// `git config core.hooksPath` was empty. `make install-hooks` had never been run there, so
// `.githooks/commit-msg` -- the one thing standing between a long subject and published
// history -- was never consulted for a single commit. The hook is opt-in per clone and
// nothing reports that it is off, which makes "install the hook" a defence that silently
// defaults to absent. Until something surfaces an unset `core.hooksPath`, this table will
// keep growing one published subject at a time. TASK-341 owns that gap.
