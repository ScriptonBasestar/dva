// module. A declaration written inside a file named under `modules:` lives in a document
// this function never opens, so it is invisible here, including to the "Left for you" list
// `dva config migrate` prints: nothing walks the merged view this check's raw-node approach
// deliberately avoids. `dva config validate` is the only surface that sees it, because it
