//
// Scope is deliberately narrow: a *reserved* prefix, and since TASK-167 that is the whole

// the same way — run.go split every key on ':' — and TASK-167 answered that as the routing

// LiteralKeyWins reports whether a command name should be looked up as an interaction key
// as written, rather than split on ':' and read as `<subproject>:<command>`.
//
// run.go used to split unconditionally, before asking whether the literal key existed. That
// made every colon key whose prefix was not a declared subproject reachable by nothing:
// `dva mytool:fast` exited 1 with "subproject `mytool` not found" while `dva config validate`
// said the file was valid and `dva manifest` advertised `usage_example: dva mytool:fast`.
// The colon was never reserved for subprojects by the schema, the docs, or the config model
// — only by that one SplitN — so this makes routing agree with the four surfaces that
// already treated the key as an ordinary command.
//
// An exact match beats an inference: a declared key is what the author wrote, a subproject
// reference is what the shape suggests. A parent CAN declare a literal `engine:test` key of
// its own alongside a same-named `engine` subproject — nothing rejects that config — and when
// it does, this function is exactly why the literal key wins and the subproject's `test` of
// the same spelling becomes unreachable through the colon form. warnLiteralKeyShadowsSubproject
// (validate_warnings.go) exists precisely for that shape: it fires on load and names the
// `dva run --project` form that still reaches the shadowed child command.
//
// The reserved prefix is excepted so `compose:ps` keeps failing. Validate rejects such a
// config outright (rc 1, reserved conflict), and routing it here would ship a file that one
// surface calls a hard error while another runs it happily — the disagreement TASK-137 was
// about. It also keeps `unroutable_reason` ("prefix is a reserved DVA command") a true and
// complete account of what is left unroutable. TASK-167.
//
// The exception is keyed off the live reserved set, so removing a built-in moves keys out of
// it: `app:build` was unroutable while `app` was a command and is an ordinary interaction
