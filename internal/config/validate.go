// path on which it could fire, whatever it or its parent is named.
//
// This used to iterate c.Interaction only, so moving the identical hook one level down
// turned a rc-1 validation failure into silence. Measured on v0.1.44, all three shapes
// validated clean with the hook dead:
//
//	interaction.db.subcommands.migrate.before      `dva db migrate` → MIGRATING, rc 0
//	interaction.up.subcommands.fast.before         parent hookable; `fast` never registers
//	interaction.db.subcommands.up.before           `dva db up` → DB-UP, rc 0

// IsHookableCommand(leaf) waves it through — the leaf is literally called `up` — while the
// hook is exactly as dead as the other two.
//
// An error, not a warning, against the warnInertProvisionSteps precedent that a
// long-inert key should not start failing configs at upgrade. That precedent rests on the
// failure being observable: warnIgnoredParallelSteps records that a dropped `parallel:`
// "produces exactly the right output and merely takes twice as long". A skipped
// `before: [backup]` produces exactly the right output and no signal at all — and measured,
// semantic warnings do not reach the run path, so `dva db migrate` prints MIGRATING and
// nothing else. Warning here would reach nobody except someone already suspicious, which is
// not the person running a migration. The config an error breaks at upgrade is a config
// whose backup was never running; saying so is the point.
//
// Not fixed by making nested hooks execute: that is a runner change, not a validation one,
