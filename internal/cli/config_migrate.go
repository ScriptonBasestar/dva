var configMigrateCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "migrate [path]",
	Short: "Convert legacy declarations into the stack/plan shape",
	Long: `Convert the declarations DVA has moved on from.

This opt-in compatibility command is tracked by TASK-197 and will be removed in
a future release once the corpus-based removal predicate in
docs/42-migration-and-compatibility.md is satisfied.

It converts:

  compose entries   ->  stack.<name>.runners.compose
  applications:     ->  stack.<name>.runners.native
  stack.*.order     ->  plans.<plan>.entries[].order

The compose rewrite repairs a shape DVA refuses to load at all. The other two
convert shapes that still load but that nothing reads on the plan path: an
order left on a stack declaration is overwritten by the plan entry's own value,
so a config that declares it and runs through a plan is not ordered by it.

It also reorders top-level sections into the canonical order 'dva config
validate' asks for — unlike the conversions above, this is not a deprecation
and will not be removed. Only known section names move; an unrecognized
top-level key keeps its own position.

Conversion is per declaration. Anything that cannot be converted mechanically
is left exactly where it is and listed under "left for you" with what it did
and where that behaviour now lives — 'modes' is always in that list, because
one mode spreads across plans, environments and the entries' own runners and
which plan it becomes is a naming decision rather than a derivation.

Prints the result by default and changes nothing; pass --write to apply. Only
the migrated declarations are rewritten — every other line keeps its original
bytes, comments and blank lines included. The migrated config is loaded and
validated in memory first, so a file is never written in a state DVA cannot
read.
