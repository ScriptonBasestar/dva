// Name and Finding are deliberately different jobs, because one string cannot do both.
// Name is the check's stable identity — it must read the same whether the check passed or
// failed, so that a --json consumer can correlate runs and so that [pass] rows read as
// English. That forces Name into the shape of the assertion the check makes
// ("Docker daemon accessible"), which is exactly why it cannot also be the failure line:
// printed after [FAIL] it states the desired state as though it had been observed, and the
// only thing carrying the negation is a four-character tag that a grep, a copied line or a
// summary drops (TASK-139).
//
// Finding is what was actually observed, phrased so it cannot read as its own opposite. It
// is set only on rows that can fail, rendered only on the failure path, and omitted from
// JSON when empty. A check whose Name is already finding-shaped — those emitted only on
// failure, one per offending item — needs no Finding.
