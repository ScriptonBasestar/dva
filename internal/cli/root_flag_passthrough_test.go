// The commands that hand their arguments to docker (`dva compose`, `dva logs`,
// `dva stack log`) set DisableFlagParsing and appended args verbatim, so DVA's own root
// flags became docker's. Measured on 0.1.44:
//
//	dva --debug stack log infra --tail=5   -> docker compose … logs --debug infra --tail=5
//	dva --debug --json compose logs        -> docker compose … --debug --json logs
//	dva --debug logs --tail=5              -> docker compose … logs --debug --tail=5
//
// The middle one is the worst-positioned: those two land before the subcommand, so they
// are offered to `docker compose` itself rather than to `logs`.

// ExecReplace → syscall.Exec, which would replace the *test binary*; the exec'd program's exit
// status then becomes the test's, and a broken assertion reports `ok` (the failure mode that
// cost TASK-094 two false-passing probes). forceSubprocess is the seam the hook wrapper already
// uses to keep the Go process alive, and execution_paths_test.go already drives it, so the
// passthrough runs as a subprocess and returns here.

// PATH is rebuilt as shim:/bin:/usr/bin rather than prepended to the caller's, and the test
