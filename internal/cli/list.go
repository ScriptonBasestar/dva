// Two conditions, checked in the order interactionUsage checks its own: unroutable first,
// because a key nothing reaches has no working form for the shadow branch to name.
//
//  1. The child's own validator rejects the key (TASK-342 / TASK-263 §3 decision (b)). Every
//     parent route then refuses it — `--project` and the colon shorthand in
//     runSubprojectCommand, a `p/k` import at load — so there is no usage to advertise. This
//     state did not exist before those routes started refusing; a subproject key used to be
//     reachable through `dva run --project` no matter what, which is what the D1 note this
//     comment replaced recorded.
//  2. config.LiteralKeyWins — the parent declares the same `<project>:<key>` string as one of
//     its own interaction: keys, and that literal key wins the colon form. Reuse it rather
//     than reimplementing: it is the same predicate warnLiteralKeyShadowsSubproject
//     (internal/config/validate_warnings.go) is built around.
//
// The rejection is asked about the DECLARED key (cmd.Path[0]), not the flattened display key:
// runSubprojectCommand checks args[0] and never looks at the rest, so a rejected `status`
// kills the `status build` subcommand row too. Same no-length-guard reasoning interactionUsage
// spells out for a dead namespace prefix.
//
// unroutableReason comes back from the same call that decides unroutable rather than being
// re-derived by the caller, because it is the child's verdict, not a property of the key
// string — see config.RejectsInteractionKey. That is why this returns four values where
