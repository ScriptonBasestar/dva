// runCompositionRestart restarts every composed child in place, in wave order, per TASK-260
// §4.3's frozen contract: "Wave 순서대로 각 child에 restart — child 내부는 child 자신의
// restart 의미(개별 entry 재시작)를 그대로 쓰고, root는 child 단위로만 순서를 준다." That is
// deliberately NOT a whole-composition Stop followed by a whole-composition Up: this walks
// comp.Entries directly (already resolved in wave, order, name order — the same order
// compositionChildNames documents) and, for each child in turn, stops that one child and
// brings that one child back up, mirroring lifecycle.Orchestrator.Restart's own stop-then-up
// short-circuit but scoped to a single child. lifecycle.CompositionOrchestrator has no
// Restart of its own — TASK-291's frozen surface stays Up/Down/Stop/Status only
// (composition_orchestrator.go) — restart is composed here from the same per-child Up/Stop
// the executor already exposes, not a fifth orchestrator method.
//
// Because each child's restart is independent, one child's failure never rolls back another
// child that already came back up: there is no whole-composition rollback to opt out of, so
// --no-rollback keeps being rejected for this verb by validateCompositionFlagScope the same
// way it always has (TASK-298 gap A).

// restartCompositionChildren implements runCompositionRestart's per-child loop. Each child
// gets exec.Stop then exec.Up, in that order. A failure at either step marks that child
// "failed" in the report, records a diagnostic sentence explaining the child's resulting
// state (mirroring composition_orchestrator.go's rollback-failure diagnostics, TASK-298 gap
// B), and halts — every not-yet-restarted child (the rest of this wave, and every later
// wave) is left "not_started" rather than attempted. TASK-260 §5.2 step 1 requires this for
// `up`'s wave processing ("Wave N의 child가 실패하면, Wave N 안에서 그 실패한 child 이후의
// child는 시작하지 않는다"), and restart has no per-verb exemption from it: unlike `up`,
// restart has no rollback to unwind an already-succeeded child, so a later wave's child
// would otherwise be restarted against a dependency this call just found broken. A stop
// failure leaves the child's own state ambiguous (it may still be up, or partially torn
// down); an up failure after a successful stop leaves it definitely down, where it was up
// before this call started. Both are exactly the kind of state an operator cannot infer from
// the structured report's per-child State/Error alone, which is why they get a Diagnostics
// sentence instead of only a report row.
