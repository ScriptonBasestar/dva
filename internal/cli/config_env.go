decrypts on its own, and lifecycle commands never unseal implicitly. Both
subcommands here are explicit, one target at a time.

  dva config env unseal   write the decrypted target

only when a single entry declares sops_source; with several, naming one is

sops' output directly, is validated as dotenv, and only then replaces the target.
