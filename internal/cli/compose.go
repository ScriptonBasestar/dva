Without a plan name it uses default_plan, or the only plan when exactly one
is declared. With several plans and no default_plan it refuses and asks you
to name one. With no plans configured it starts every declared stack entry.

A leading -- is a separator, never an argument: "dva up --" does exactly what a
bare "dva up" does in that config, and "dva up -- X" is read exactly as
"dva up X" -- including when that is a refusal. So a wrapper written as
'dva up -- "$@"' is safe when "$@" is empty. Only the LEADING one is consumed:
"dva up -- --" is still an error, and a -- written after something else is left
alone.

Plan usage:
  dva up <plan>           Start the selected plan
  --force                 Compose only: pass --force-recreate (other plugins ignore)
  --no-wait               Return without waiting for readiness
  --var KEY=VAL           Override a plan variable
  --dry-run               Print the variable resolution and the actions, without executing

		// faithfully and it inherits whatever `dva up X` does, including where that is wrong.
		// `dva up -` accepted a bare dash when this was written, so the identity inherited that

Without a plan name it uses default_plan, or the only plan when exactly one
is declared. With several plans and no default_plan it refuses and asks you
to name one. With no plans configured it restarts every declared stack entry.

The first argument is read as a plan name when it names a plan, and as a stack
entry name otherwise; the two cannot be combined.

Plan usage:
  dva restart <plan>      Restart the selected plan
  --var KEY=VAL           Override a plan variable (plan only)
  --no-wait               Return without waiting for readiness (plan only)
  --dry-run               Print the variable resolution and the actions, without executing

--var and --no-wait apply only when a plan is being restarted. On the stack path
they are rejected rather than accepted and ignored: it always waits, and there
are no plan variables to override.

Stack usage:
  dva restart <entry>     Restart only the named stack entries (works in any config)
  dva restart -- <name>   Read what follows as names, never as flags

A name matching no declared stack entry is an error. That rule is restart's own,
not a parity with its siblings: restart is the only lifecycle verb taking stack
entry names at all, up reads a positional as a plan name and rejects a real entry
with "plan not found", and down and stop refuse positionals outright. After --
every argument is a name whatever it spells, so a flag written there is reported
as an unknown name rather than silently dropped.

A bare "dva restart --" means "no names given" and does whatever a bare
"dva restart" does in that config, with no exceptions: it restarts every declared
entry where a bare restart does, it runs the default plan where a bare restart
runs it, and it refuses to guess where several plans are configured. Wrapper
scripts should know that "dva restart -- $@" with an empty "$@" restarts
everything in a plan-less config; it was a no-op before TASK-207. A config with a
resolvable default plan — an explicit default_plan, or a lone plan, which counts
as one — was the last exception, and TASK-210 removed it: the terminator is a
separator, so what follows it is classified, never the separator itself.

		// silently swallowed; whether they should warn and continue, as `dva up` does for

		// Do NOT restate that as "the config declares no plans at all" — measured false.

		// plans configured. The second is the worse half of the defect this guard closes:
		// before it, that invocation restarted s1 and exited 0 having silently discarded

		//
		// The `--` terminator is exempt from the FLAG check, and it is the one place restart
		// must not copy up. parseDvaFlags keeps the terminator deliberately so each caller can

		// restart does take them, so `dva restart -- s1` is the ordinary way to say s1 is a

		// four cases by accident. They are one class, because after `--` every token is a name
		// whatever it spells, so a single name-shaped check answers all four.
		//
		// Consuming the terminator has to come first, and it is what makes rejecting the rest
		// safe. 198's comment argued the token had to stay in names, reasoning that an empty
		// Names means "every entry" to lifecycle, so dropping it would escalate `dva restart --`
		// from a no-op into a stop+start of the whole stack. The premise is right and the
		// conclusion does not survive the next line: with unknown names rejected, keeping it
		// makes `dva restart --` exit 1 instead — and `dva restart -- "$@"` with an empty "$@"
		// is the exact idiom `--` exists for, whose meaning is "no names given", i.e. exactly
		// what a bare `dva restart` does. Dropping it is what preserves that; the escalation
		// 198 measured is the correct behaviour once the token means "separator" here.
		//
		// Emptying the name list re-opens a gate that has already run. requirePlanSelection is
		// called above against the RAW args, where ["--"] counts as "a token was given", so a
		// config with several plans and no default_plan lets it through — and dropping the token
		// then leaves zero names, which lifecycle reads as "every entry". Measured, not reasoned
		// about: `dva restart --` stopped and started the whole stack in a config whose bare
		// `dva restart` is refused as too ambiguous to act on. That is 198's escalation arriving
		// from the other side, so the gate is re-applied. Found by review; the test above
		// asserted the divergence as correct.
		//
		// It is re-applied on the RAW args, not on the empty name list, and the difference is
		// the whole guard. An empty `names` is not the terminator's signature: `dva restart
		// --tag web` empties it too, and so does every other stack selector. A first draft
		// gated on `len(names) == 0` alone and refused all of them — measured, `restart --tag
		// web` went from rc=0 bouncing s1 on master to rc=1 "multiple plans configured", while
		// `up --tag web` and `stop --tag web` kept working, making restart the one lifecycle
		// verb whose tag filter needs a plan name. `restart --mode dev` stopped reporting the
		// unknown mode and reported the plan gate instead. The raw-args gate above has already
		// ruled on flag-only invocations — any surviving token means "do not ask for a plan" —
		// and that ruling stands. Only an invocation whose every token was the terminator means
		// "no names given", so that is what this asks: strip --debug/--json exactly as the gate
		// itself does, drop the terminator, and require nothing else to be left.
		//
		// The identity this restores is with the STACK route. The PLAN route was decided one
		// card later: a config with a default_plan refused `dva restart --` earlier still, from
		// rejectSuppressedDefaultPlan, because args[0] starts with "-". TASK-210 consumed the
		// leading terminator in detectPlanRoute and in that helper instead, which is why this
		// gate now sees an empty list here rather than being unreachable in that shape.

	// it into ["", ""] — two tags nothing carries. For --exclude-tag, matching nothing means
	// excluding nothing, so that spelling bounced the entire stack at rc=0: the same harm
	// TASK-211 and the check above were filed against, reached one character past the
	// spelling they refuse. `--tag=,` is the mirror and fails the other way, running nothing
	// and still exiting 0. Both were measured on the unfixed build, and the first draft of
	// TASK-213 examined only the second and called the family harmless.

	// differently — for the ~25 runes unicode.IsSpace calls space, which is the boundary
	// this draws and not the boundary "invisible" would draw. `--tag=<U+200B>` is a
	// zero-width space, is not IsSpace, and passes as a one-element list; it then matches
	// no declared tag, which lands it in TASK-214 with every other tag no entry carries.
	// Widening this check to "unprintable" would be a second, different rule about what a
	// tag may be made of, and it belongs with the code that validates tag names.
	//
	// Nothing is trimmed off the values that survive: an element with surrounding spaces is
	// a tag that will not match, which is an unknown-tag complaint rather than this one.
	// Rewriting the user's input on the way through would hide that from them.
