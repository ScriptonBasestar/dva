title: "`make lint` fails on a cold cache because `mise exec` pairs a mismatched go and GOROOT"
type: bug
priority: P2
effort: S
created-at: 2026-08-19T18:39:59+09:00
source: "found while re-running TASK-203's reproduction against the landed fix — the control worktree's first `make lint` failed with 4 typecheck errors that had nothing to do with the cache"
scope: "Makefile lint target: detect a go/GOROOT mismatch and say so. No change to which linters run, no Go source change. The mismatched toolchain is an environment condition, but the target's preference for `mise exec` is what converts it into a failure — the bare `golangci-lint` branch is measured to pass on the same machine — so this is not purely environmental. Choosing between the two branches is Open Question 1; this card only makes the build report the condition legibly instead of as four import errors."

  Implemented in 07d0c47, hardened in 4cbfdcd. Reviewed by an independent session that did
  not write the change; three in-process review agents before it terminated without
  delivering a report, so the review that counts is the cross-session one.
  It found that the guard shipped in 07d0c47 could exit 0 having read neither version —
  both substitutions yield the empty string on failure and two empty strings compare equal.
  That finding was reproduced here before being acted on rather than accepted on report,
  including the broader trigger the reviewer supplied: a `go` that is present and
  executable but exits non-zero (`#!/bin/sh` / `exit 3` stub) gave `tool=[] root=[]` rc=0.
  One leg of the reviewer's argument did not survive checking — that `make vet` gates a
  broken GOROOT first holds under an ambient PATH (rc=2) but not through the mise shim
  (rc=0), which sanitises GOROOT. It was cited toward lesser severity, so its collapse
  strengthens rather than weakens the conclusion; recorded on the card either way.
  Re-measured after the fix in all three directions: unreadable pairing fails naming both
  empty values; mismatch still fails with `Error 1` and zero `could not import` lines;
  healthy pairing still runs through to `0 issues.`
  Two of this card's own acceptance bindings were defective and were corrected with the
  reason stated, not adjusted to fit the code — one bound on a shell-syntax literal that no
  Makefile can contain, so it could never pass, the mirror of the never-fails shape
  TASK-205 exists for.
  All six bindings on this card re-run and passing. Gates at 4cbfdcd: doc-check,
  check-generate, lint, test, commit-check, and `ce task validate --all` across 9 cards,
  all green.

## Summary

`make lint` exits 2 with four `typecheck` errors whenever the golangci-lint cache is cold
*and* the shell resolves a `go` that disagrees with the `GOROOT` mise exports. The errors
name stdlib imports and read as if the tree does not compile:

```
tools/cilabels/main.go:11:2: could not import os (.../go/1.26.5/src/os/dir.go:8:2:
  could not import internal/bytealg (... compile: version "go1.26.5" does not match
  go tool version "go1.26.6"))) (typecheck)
```

The tree compiles fine — `go vet ./...` and `go build` both pass in the same run, and
the *same* golangci-lint binary reports `0 issues.` when invoked without the `mise exec`
wrapper. The failure is a toolchain pairing defect inside the wrapper.

**Measured mechanism.** The `lint` target prefers `mise exec -- golangci-lint`. Under
that wrapper:

| what | value |
|---|---|
| `go` binary actually resolved | `/opt/homebrew/bin/go` → **go1.26.6** |
| `GOROOT` mise exports | `~/.local/share/mise/installs/go/1.26.5` → **go1.26.5** |

go 1.26.6 runs, looks up its tools in a GOROOT belonging to 1.26.5, finds `compile`
1.26.5, and refuses the pair. Homebrew's go 1.26.6 was installed **2026-08-18 15:51**;
`.mise.toml` and `go.mod` both pin 1.26.5. In the PATH `mise exec` *constructs*,
`/opt/homebrew/bin` (position 15) precedes mise's own go install directory (position 20).
That signature holds in every failing run measured — but it describes the PATH the wrapper
built, not the PATH you handed it, and **no predicate anyone has proposed predicts which
one you will get**: four have been tried and all four are falsified below. That is a
weaker claim than "nothing inspectable could predict it", which six PATH variants do not
license. See the grid below before drawing any PATH conclusion from this table.

**Single-variable confirmation.** Holding everything else fixed and changing only which
`go` the wrapper resolves:

| `go` resolved | GOROOT | cold `golangci-lint run ./...` |
|---|---|---|
| Homebrew 1.26.6 | mise 1.26.5 | rc=1, `4 issues: * typecheck: 4` |
| mise 1.26.5 (shim first on PATH) | mise 1.26.5 | **rc=0, `0 issues.`** |

Neither `env -u GOROOT` nor an explicit `GOROOT=` override changes the outcome — mise
re-exports `GOROOT` itself.

## Workaround, and four explanations that turned out to be wrong

Putting mise's **shims** directory first resolves `go` to the version `GOROOT` names, and
the gate goes green:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/mise/shims:$PATH"
make lint      # measured on a cold cache: rc 0, "0 issues."
```

**That is a working configuration, not the condition** — and it is worth being blunt about
how much stronger that statement is than it looks. Four rules have been proposed for when
this fires. Every one was stated by someone who had measured something real, and every one
is falsified below. They are written down so the next reader spends the ten minutes reading
rather than the hour re-deriving.

The grid. Everything else held, each variant in its own process, run under `mise exec` in
the repo worktree, 2026-08-19. Reproduced independently by a second session on this
machine, cell for cell:

| # | PATH handed to `mise exec` | `go` it resolves | pair |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | as an activated shell inherits it | `/opt/homebrew/bin/go` 1.26.6 | **broken** |
| D1 | A, minus every `installs/go/*` entry | `/opt/homebrew/bin/go` 1.26.6 | **broken** |
| D2 | D1, minus the shims entry as well | mise 1.26.5 | ok |
| E | `installs/go/1.26.5/bin` + a minimal clean PATH | mise 1.26.5 | ok |
| F | a minimal clean PATH, no mise entries at all | mise 1.26.5 | ok |
| G | shims + a minimal clean PATH | mise 1.26.5 | ok |

What that kills:

1. **"mise directories must come first" / PATH ordering.** F and G sit at opposite
   extremes and both pass, while A fails with mise's own go install directory already at
   **position 1** of the inherited PATH. Ordering co-varies; it does not decide.
2. **"The directory is the axis"** — that a directory where mise's go tool is not active
   behaves differently. It does not. *Evidence: not the grid above*, whose rows are all
   same-directory — it is a second run of that whole grid in a `git archive` extraction
   directory, which gave identical results row for row. This hypothesis was **mine**; it
   survived as long as it did because the single in-repo cell supporting it came from the
   peer session, which later disclosed that cell had been measured with a PATH it had
   already fixed and had stopped counting as a variable. I did not ask what else could
   produce that cell before building on it.
3. **"It breaks when `mise exec` inherits a PATH holding mise's own go install
   directory."** Falsified in both directions by a single run: **E** has that directory and
   passes, **D1** has none and fails. Note what this would have cost — a Makefile check
   grepping for that path would look for a string that is *present* in a working
   configuration and *absent* in a broken one.
4. **"mise's recorded activation state is stale."** *Evidence: also not the grid above*,
   which has no environment-variable rows — this is a separate experiment holding the raw
   PATH fixed at row A and varying only the activation variables. `__MISE_DIFF`,
   `__MISE_ORIG_PATH`, `__MISE_SESSION` and `MISE_SHELL` are all exported by zsh
   activation. Clearing them individually and together changes nothing — every variant
   stays `go1.26.6` against `GOROOT` 1.26.5.

Also not the axis: `mise trust`. It looks like it should be, since extraction directories
are untrusted and the repo is trusted, but with the directory byte-identical and the two
arms in **separate processes** both trust states break alike. An A/B that runs both arms
inside one shell invocation will appear to confirm it, because the trust write never
reaches the second arm.

**What is actually established.** The ambient shell — no `mise exec` — resolves a
*consistent* pair. So the wrapper is not inheriting a broken environment; it degrades a
working one. The one visible difference between failing and passing runs is the PATH
`mise exec` itself constructs:

| | head of the PATH `mise exec` builds |
|---|---|
| failing (A, D1) | the pre-activation PATH — `/opt/homebrew/bin` at 15, mise's go install dir at 20 |
| passing (D2, E, F, G) | mise's install dirs at 1–6, go first |

With a heavily activated PATH the wrapper hands back something close to the pre-activation
PATH and does not re-apply its tools, while `GOROOT` stays exported from the outer
activation; with the other PATHs above it applies normally. **What separates the two cases
is not known** — the four variables above are not it. Any verb here suggesting the wrapper
*recognises* or *detects* its own activation would be inventing the answer to Open
Question 4 rather than reporting a measurement.

One detail sharpens that question rather than answering it: row **D1** has every
`installs/go/*` entry stripped out of the PATH handed in, yet the PATH the wrapper builds
still carries mise's go install dir at position 20. The wrapper is therefore
reconstructing that entry from something other than its input — its own config, or state
carried in the activation environment. Which of the two, and why only in the failing
cases, is unmeasured. It does not block this card.

It does change the argument, though, and in the card's favour. **If the trigger cannot be
predicted from the PATH a developer has, no PATH-shaped check is safe** — see the E/D1 pair
above for a plausible one that would misfire in both directions. The mismatch has to be
read where it is used. Which is what this card asks for: with it present, `make lint`
reports four `could not import` errors about stdlib packages, reads as "the tree does not
compile", and sends the reader after a defect that is not there. The condition is now met
far more often than it used to be (see below).

One thing this card cannot do is cite its own prior art. This drift was diagnosed before,
with the same `does not match go tool version` giveaway and the same remedy, but only in a
session-local note that no future reader of this repo can open. That is most of why it is
written out at length here.

## Why it is not visible today

`make lint` passes in the primary checkout because its cache
(`tmp/golangci-lint-cache`) already holds successful results. The failure appears only
when golangci-lint has to re-analyse:

- a newly created checkout or worktree — measured: a fresh export of `c100ba0` fails
  `make lint` with rc=2, cold **and** warm;
- after `make clean`, which as of TASK-203 deletes `$(CURDIR)/tmp/golangci-lint-cache`.

**The failure is wrapper-specific, and an earlier draft of this card had that backwards.**
That draft listed a third trigger — a direct `golangci-lint` invocation against a fresh
cache — and claimed it produced the same 4 typecheck errors. It does not. Measured as an
A/B in this worktree, both arms genuinely cold, 2026-08-20:

| arm | result | cache written |
|---|---|---|
| `GOLANGCI_LINT_CACHE=<fresh> golangci-lint run ./...` | **`0 issues.`** | 10,436 KB |
| `GOLANGCI_LINT_CACHE=<fresh> mise exec -- golangci-lint run ./...` | `4 issues: * typecheck: 4` | 4 KB |

Same binary in both arms — `mise which golangci-lint` and `command -v golangci-lint`
resolve to the identical path. The cache column is what makes the passing arm readable as
evidence rather than as an absence: it wrote 10 MB, so it really did analyse the tree,
while the failing arm wrote 4 KB because it never got past the import chain. Without that
column a `0 issues.` is indistinguishable from a run that did nothing — which is precisely
the failure described one paragraph down.

That correction matters beyond tidiness: the wrong bullet asserted the failure was *not*
wrapper-specific, which would have demolished this card's mechanism, its title, and the
"degrades a working environment" conclusion. It survived a rewrite because it sat in a
list of supporting details rather than in the argument.

Do **not** try the cold-cache route through `make`. The `lint` recipe assigns
`GOLANGCI_LINT_CACHE`
unconditionally, so an environment override is discarded and the run quietly uses the
checkout's warm cache instead. Measured here: the supplied directory stayed 0 KB while
`tmp/golangci-lint-cache` was created beside it. A run intended to be cold reads as a pass
without ever having been cold — registered separately as TASK-205. Until that is fixed,
force a cold run with `make clean`, or by moving the cache directory aside.

TASK-203's per-checkout cache scoping is correct and is **not** the cause, but it does
remove what was masking this: every task now starts from a cold cache by design, so a
condition that used to hide behind one long-lived shared cache is now met on every new
worktree.

## Reproduction

1. `mkdir -p tmp/probe && git archive HEAD | tar -x -C tmp/probe`
2. `cd tmp/probe && make lint`
3. Observe rc=2 and `4 issues: * typecheck: 4`, with `does not match go tool version`
   inside the import chain.
4. `PATH="$HOME/.local/share/mise/shims:$PATH" make lint` → rc=0, `0 issues.`

Step 4 uses the shims form from the Workaround above, which is the variant actually
measured (row G). An earlier draft named a hand-built directory holding a `go` symlink —
that variant appears nowhere in the grid and should not be reproduced from.

## Proposed fix

Make the `lint` target refuse to run golangci-lint when the resolved `go` and the
exported `GOROOT` disagree, and print both versions. This follows the same principle the
target already applies to `gopls check` (TASK-130): a tool that cannot run must not be
allowed to read as a clean lint, and the failure must name its own cause.

The comparison itself is two lines, but **how it is invoked decides whether it works at
all**, and the obvious way is wrong. Measured 2026-08-20:

```
mise exec -- go version                → go1.26.5    mismatch INVISIBLE
mise exec -- sh -c 'go version'        → go1.26.6    mismatch visible
mise exec -- sh -c 'command -v go'     → /opt/homebrew/bin/go
```

`mise exec` resolves a `go` given **directly as its argument** through its own tool table,
not through the PATH it constructs. golangci-lint is a separate binary that afterwards
finds `go` on that PATH — which is why golangci-lint breaks while `mise exec -- go version`
looks healthy. A check written the obvious way would therefore report a matched pair on a
machine that is currently broken: a gate that cannot fail, on a card whose sibling
TASK-205 exists because of a gate that could not fail. It has to resolve `go` the way the
linter does — through PATH, in a subshell, under the wrapper:

```bash
mise exec -- sh -c '
  tool=$(go version | cut -d" " -f3)                 # broken: go1.26.6   ok: go1.26.5
  root=$(head -1 "$(go env GOROOT)/VERSION")         # broken: go1.26.5   ok: go1.26.5
  [ "$tool" = "$root" ]'
```

`head -1` is required, not cosmetic: `$(go env GOROOT)/VERSION` is **two** lines
(`go1.26.5` then a `time …` stamp), so a bare `cat` compared against one-line `go version`
output differs on a *correctly* paired machine and would fail the gate everywhere.

The environment condition is fixed separately, by whichever of these the maintainer
prefers — removing or unlinking the Homebrew `go`, or moving `.mise.toml` and `go.mod` to
1.26.6. **Neither has been tested**, and per Open Question 4 nobody yet knows what makes
the wrapper revert, so treat both as candidates rather than known fixes. That choice is
out of scope here; this card only makes the build diagnose the condition.

## Completion Criteria

- [x] The lint target inspects the toolchain pairing before running golangci-lint.
      verify: `grep -c 'go env GOROOT' Makefile` → at least 1 (today: **0**)
- [x] A mismatched pairing fails with a message naming both versions, not with typecheck
      errors about stdlib imports.
      verify: human — construct the mismatch by putting a differing `go` first on PATH,
      run `make lint`, and confirm the output names the two versions and does not print
      `could not import`
- [x] The check **compares two versions it reads at run time**. It must not sniff a PATH,
      a directory name, or a hard-coded version — the grid above contains a measured case
      where a path check is present in a working configuration and absent in a broken one,
      so such a check would misfire in both directions.
      verify: `grep -c 'GOROOT)/VERSION' Makefile` → at least 1 (today: **0**); measured
      to read `go1.26.6` vs `go1.26.5` when broken and to match when not
      verify: `grep -c 'head -1 "$$(go env GOROOT)/VERSION"' Makefile` → at least 1
      (today: **0**) — the `VERSION` file is two lines, so a bare `cat` fails the gate on
      a correctly paired machine. Bound on the `$$` form because that is the literal a
      Makefile holds — make collapses it to one `$` before `/bin/sh` sees it, so a binding
      written in shell syntax matches nothing and can never pass.
      + regression guard, not an acceptance test: `grep -c '1\.26\.[0-9]' Makefile` stays
      **0**, so no specific version is baked into the gate
- [x] No change to which linters run.
      + regression guard, not an acceptance test:
      `grep -c 'golangci-lint run ./...' Makefile` → 2, unchanged
- [x] The reported `go`/`GOROOT` pairing is read the way **golangci-lint** resolves it —
      through PATH, in a subshell, under the wrapper — not as a direct `mise exec`
      argument and not from the ambient shell. Both of those report a matched pair on a
      machine that is currently broken, so a check written either way can never fire.
      verify: `grep -c "mise exec -- sh -c" Makefile` → at least 1 (today: **0**)
      verify: human — measured discriminator, must hold on this machine today:
      `mise exec -- go version` → `go1.26.5` (mismatch invisible) while
      `mise exec -- sh -c 'go version'` → `go1.26.6` (mismatch visible)
- [x] A pairing the guard **cannot read** fails, with its own message rather than the
      mismatch one. Either substitution failing yields the empty string, and two empty
      strings compare equal, so the comparison alone reports health having verified
      nothing — the failure this card and TASK-205 both exist to remove, one level up.
      verify: `grep -c 'cannot read the go/GOROOT pairing' Makefile` → at least 1
      (today, on 07d0c47: **0**)
      verify: human — put a `#!/bin/sh` / `exit 3` stub named `go` first on PATH and run
      the guard's collapsed script; it must exit 1 naming both empty values, where before
      it printed `tool=[] root=[]` and exited 0

## Verification (2026-08-20)

Implemented in the `lint` target, ahead of the golangci-lint invocation. Open Question 1
was answered **hard-fail**: the fallback branch would let a broken machine pass quietly,
which is the shape this card and TASK-205 both exist to remove.

| arm | PATH handed to `make` | result |
|---|---|---|
| A | as an activated shell supplies it — broken pairing | guard fires, `make: *** [lint] Error 1`, **no** `could not import` |
| B | mise shims first — consistent pairing | guard silent, `go vet` clean, `gofmt -s: 285 files checked, 0 unformatted`, `0 issues.` |

Arm A's output, verbatim:

```
make lint: go and GOROOT disagree - go tool is go1.26.6, GOROOT holds go1.26.5
  go:     /opt/homebrew/bin/go
  GOROOT: /Users/archmagece/.local/share/mise/installs/go/1.26.5
  Unchecked, this surfaces as could-not-import errors about stdlib packages. TASK-204.
```

The arms differ only in PATH — the tree is byte-identical across them — which is what
makes arm B readable as *the guard does not fire on a healthy machine* rather than *the
guard is inert*.

**One binding was wrong, and was corrected rather than quietly dropped.** As registered,
criterion 3 bound on `grep -c 'head -1 "$(go env GOROOT)/VERSION"'`. A Makefile recipe must
write `$$` for a literal `$`, so that string cannot occur in any correct implementation:
the criterion could never *pass* — the mirror image of the never-fails shape TASK-205
exists for. The binding now names the `$$` form. What it was written to demand is unchanged
and is met: `head -1` is present, and the reason it is required sits beside it.

### The guard shipped in 07d0c47 could report health without verifying anything

Found in review of that commit, fixed before integration. The comparison was
`[ "$tool" != "$root" ]` and nothing else. If either substitution fails it yields the
empty string, **two empty strings compare equal**, and the guard exits 0 in silence —
output indistinguishable from a verified match.

| case | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `go` absent from PATH | `PASS tool=[] root=[]` rc=**0** | rc=**1**, names both empty values |
| `go` present, executable, exits 3 | `PASS tool=[] root=[]` rc=**0** | rc=**1**, same message |
| healthy pairing | silent, rc=0 | silent, rc=0 — unchanged |

The second row is the one that matters: the trigger is not *no go on PATH*, it is *either
read failing*. And the reachable environment is not a hand-built PATH — it is any machine
where go comes only through mise, a CI runner or a fresh box, because `mise exec` reverts
toward the pre-activation PATH. On this machine the guard was non-vacuous only because a
second toolchain, Homebrew's go, happens to exist — which is the very condition this card
detects.

It also degraded the wrong way. A **partial** failure makes the two strings differ, so the
guard fired loudly about a mismatch that did not exist; a **total** failure passed in
silence. The worse environment produced the quieter output.

Two failure modes now carry two messages, since "go and GOROOT disagree" would be false
when neither could be read. Both arms above were re-measured after the fix and are
unchanged: mismatch still fails with `Error 1` and no `could not import` line, healthy
still runs through to `0 issues.`

Rejected counter-argument, recorded because it is the strongest one available: the guard's
remit is a *pairing mismatch*, so an unreadable toolchain is a different fault with a
better-placed diagnostician, and hard-failing turns an environment problem into a lint red.
It loses on a measured premise rather than on principle — golangci-lint runs under the same
`mise exec` and resolves `go` through the same PATH the guard's subshell uses, so "the
guard cannot read go" and "lint works" cannot coexist. Hard-failing therefore produces no
false reds; it produces the true red earlier, with a name on it. (One leg of that argument
— that `make vet` gates a broken GOROOT first — was checked and holds only under an ambient
PATH, where `go` is the real binary: `GOROOT=/nonexistent go vet` gives rc=2 there, but
rc=0 through the mise shim, which sanitises GOROOT. It was cited toward *less* severity, so
its collapse does not weaken the conclusion.)

The same defect appeared in the guard's own comment, which explained the rule as
`$(GOROOT)/VERSION`. In a recipe line make expands that to the empty string before
`/bin/sh` sees it, so the comment described a literal the file does not contain. It now
reads `$$(go env GOROOT)/VERSION`, matching the code it explains.

## Open Questions

1. Should the target hard-fail on a mismatch, or warn and fall back to the bare
   `golangci-lint` branch, which is measured to work? Failing is more honest; falling
   back keeps the gate usable on a machine nobody has cleaned up yet.
2. ~~Is the mismatch reproducible in other sessions?~~ **Answered: yes, everywhere.** Two
   independent sessions reproduce it, in a checkout and in a `git archive` extraction
   directory alike, with PATH as an activated shell supplies it. Neither the session nor
   the directory is an axis. An earlier table in this card showed the two sessions
   disagreeing inside the repo; that cell came from the **peer session**, and was an
   artifact of its having already applied the workaround and stopped counting it as a
   variable — disclosed by that session itself. Re-measured without
   it, both break. Every shell here with mise activation applied is in the failing
   configuration by default — which is why the primary checkout passes on a warm cache
   rather than on a working toolchain.
3. `go vet` and `gopls check` are unaffected here (both passed in every failing run),
   but neither was tested under a deliberately mismatched pairing.
4. **What state makes `mise exec` hand back the pre-activation PATH instead of applying
   its tools?** Not known. Four candidate rules are falsified above and the four
   documented activation variables are not it. An answer would allow a cheaper fix — a
   shell-side correction instead of a check in the build — but the check is worth having
   either way, because it is the only defence that does not depend on knowing the answer.
