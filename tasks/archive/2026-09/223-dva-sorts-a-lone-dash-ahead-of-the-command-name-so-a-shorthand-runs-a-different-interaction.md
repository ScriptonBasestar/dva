# Task 223: a lone dash is sorted ahead of the command name

## Summary

`Execute` rewrites `dva <interaction> <args...>` into `dva run <flags...>
<nonflags...>`, partitioning by `isFlag`, which answers `true` for a lone `-`.
So `-` is moved **in front of** the command name. With an interaction named `-`
declared, `dva greet -` becomes `run - greet`: dva runs `-` and passes `greet`
to it as an argument.

The user named `greet`. Something else ran. Exit code 0.

## Measured

Fixture: `dva.yml` declaring two interactions, `greet` and `-`, each echoing its
own marker and its arguments. `dva validate` exits 0 on it — nothing in dva
validates the charset of an interaction name. Binary built from
`celee__fix__217-218-terminator-and-dash-guards`, 2026-08-21.

```
dva greet            rc=0   RAN_GREET_with=[]
dva greet -          rc=0   RAN_DASH_with=[] greet      ← wrong interaction, rc=0
dva run greet -      rc=0   RAN_GREET_with=[] -         ← explicit form: correct
dva greet -v         rc=1   ERROR: unknown shorthand flag: 'v' in -v
dva -                rc=0   (root help)
dva run -            rc=0   RAN_DASH_with=[]
```

Two rows carry the defect. `dva greet -` and `dva run greet -` are documented as
the same command, and they disagree. And the sugar form's disagreement is not a
refusal — it is an action.

Without an interaction named `-`, the same rewrite produces ``ERROR: command `-`
not recognized!`` — a confusing message that blames the wrong token, but at
least rc=1.

## Cause

`internal/cli/root.go`:

```go
:190   if !isTopLevelCommand(firstArg) && !isFlag(firstArg) {
:210           if isFlag(a) {
:212-213       } else { nonFlags = append(nonFlags, a) }
:216   args = append([]string{"run"}, append(flags, nonFlags...)...)
:217   os.Args = append([]string{os.Args[0]}, args...)

:247   func isFlag(s string) bool { return len(s) > 0 && s[0] == '-' }
```

The two call sites are not the same slot:

- `:190` gates the interaction lookup. A wrong answer here only *hides* an
  interaction named `-` — `dva -` prints root help instead of running it. Costly
  only to a config nobody has.
- `:210` classifies **every** argument, and the partition is a reordering. A
  wrong answer here changes which interaction runs.

TASK-218 left `isFlag` alone on the argument that its slot could only withhold a
shorthand. That was measured on `dva -` and `dva run -` only — the one-token
forms, which are answered at `:190`. `:210` needs two tokens to show anything,
and it was never measured. TASK-218's own card and code comments now record the
retraction.

## What to change

Undecided, and the card should not pretend otherwise. Two candidates:

1. **`isFlag` adopts the length test** (`isFlagToken`, `flagtoken.go`). One line,
   makes both slots agree with the plan-name and entry-name slots, and makes
   `dva greet -` match `dva run greet -`. Cost: `dva -` would then try to run an
   interaction named `-` rather than print root help.
2. **Leave `isFlag`, fix the partition.** `:210` only needs to move *dva's own*
   flags; a token that no dva flag matches is an argument wherever it sits. That
   is a larger change and touches every shorthand invocation, not just `-`.

Whichever lands must also answer the product question this card does not:

> Is a stack entry or interaction named `-` supported? Config validation accepts
> both today (measured). TASK-218 answered "yes" for entries by routing to them.
> If the answer is "no", the fix belongs in schema validation and all of this
> becomes a validation error instead.

## Resolution

Names consisting of `-` remain supported for both interactions and stack entries. Validation
accepts them, explicit `dva run -` already reaches such an interaction, and TASK-218 established
the same name treatment for entry slots. Adding a new validation prohibition here would break an
existing accepted and executable declaration without solving the flags-first disagreement for
ordinary interaction arguments.

Therefore `isFlag` adopts the same length rule as `isFlagToken`: a flag token must contain at
least one character after the leading dash. The dynamic rewrite also stops partitioning argv and
only prepends `run`, preserving the explicit form's order exactly. Cobra already handles valid
root and `run` flags in interspersed position and honours `--`; moving tokens adds no capability
and can detach a flag from its value. In a configuration declaring an interaction named `-`,
`dva -` consequently routes to it, matching the already-supported explicit form.

The original completion criterion named `-M dev`, but the canonical interaction contract says
`dva run` has no `-M`/`-E` selector. Both explicit `dva run greet -M dev` and the corrected
shorthand therefore refuse it; forwarding those child arguments requires `--`. The regression
criterion uses the real root/run flags `--debug` and `-e` instead of inventing mode support on the
interaction path.

The implementation extracts `dynamicRunArgs` as a pure routing helper and returns
`append([]string{"run"}, args...)` once an interaction or imported namespace is recognized.
`TestSugarFormAgreesWithExplicitRun` compares both argv and resolved interaction/arguments, while
a table pins original-order preservation for lone dash, persistent/run flags, value-taking project
selection, and the `-- -M dev` child-argument form.

## Completion Criteria

- [x] `dva greet -` and `dva run greet -` run the same interaction, in a config that also declares an interaction named `-` | verify: human — paste both, with rc and the marker line; the two must name the same interaction
- [x] The agreement is pinned by a differential test comparing the two spellings, not by an expected string | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -c 'func TestSugarFormAgreesWithExplicitRun' internal/cli/root_test.go` returns 1 (today: 0). Bound on the test's source, not on `go test -run`, which exits 0 when it matches nothing
- [x] `root_test.go`'s `{"-", true}` row and `TestDashPredicatesDisagreeOnPurpose` are updated with the argument replaced, not just the value | verify: human — both tests changed in the same commit as `root.go`, and neither is deleted
- [x] The product ruling on names like `-` is written on this card before the code changes | verify: human — a `## Resolution` section stating it
- [x] `dva greet --debug` and `dva greet -e` still reach the interaction with the flag applied, so preserving order did not break real root/run flags | verify: human — paste both; `--debug` executes the marker with debug logging and `-e` resolves the interaction in explain mode
- [x] `make test` passes | verify: `make test`
