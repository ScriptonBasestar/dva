verification-summary: |
  Fix is present and has since been generalized: the per-runner step loops were replaced by one
  shared `runStepLoop` (internal/runner/steps.go:20, TASK-094), so local, docker_compose and
  kubectl now share the corrected guard `len(cmds) == 0 && !hasStepKeys(step)` (steps.go:52).
  The runner-independent half lives in internal/runner/step_keys.go — hasStepKeys:29,
  runComposeStepKeys:42, runLegacyStepKeys:66 — with provision.go's ordering reproduced
  (compose key short-circuits the item; run: before echo:/cmd:).
  Measured on ./bin/dva 0.1.44 with a fixture using `runners.compose.command: echo`:
  control 38B, viacompose 195B, viaexec 191B, viarun 179B, viacmd 45B, viaecho 30B — all exit 0,
  every row non-zero where the task recorded 0 bytes. TestComposeKeysOnInteractionPath 17/17 PASS,
  TestStepWithoutRunIsReported 10/10 PASS, ./internal/cli -run Provision 39 PASS / 0 FAIL.
  examples sweep 16 swept / 0 failures with a broken control exiting 1.
  The Resolution's open note about a duplicated compose-argv builder was subsequently closed by
  TASK-115 (tasks/done/115-four-compose-argv-builders-share-two-bugs.md).

# Task 085: an interaction step using anything but `run:` or `note:` does nothing, silently

## Problem

`LocalRunner.executeSteps` and `DockerComposeRunner.executeSteps` handle exactly two things:
`Note` and `RunCommands()`. Every other payload key on `ProvisionItem` falls through their
emptiness check and `continue`s, producing *zero bytes of output* and exit 0.

`RunCommands()` (`config.go`) covers only `Raw` and `Run` — it does **not** fold in `Echo` or
`Cmd` — so the legacy keys are dropped by the same gap.

A field-by-path sweep, counted as `step.X`/`s.X` field accesses (a raw `.Cmd` grep is useless
here: 32 of docker_compose.go's hits are `r.Cmd`, the runner's own field):

| key | local | docker_compose | provision | hooks | compose.go |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `run:` (via `RunCommands()`) | 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 |
| `note:` | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | **0** |
| `compose_up:` | **0** | **0** | 6 | 2 | **0** |
| `compose_exec:` | **0** | **0** | 6 | 2 | **0** |
| `compose_run:` | **0** | **0** | 6 | 2 | **0** |
| `echo:` | **0** | **0** | 8 | **0** | **0** |
| `cmd:` | **0** | **0** | 9 | **0** | **0** |

Negative control: a non-existent `.NoSuchField` scores 0 everywhere, so the counting method can
report absence.

Measured end-to-end on 0.1.44, one fixture per row:

| the item | invoked as | output | exit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `step:` + `run:` (control) | `dva run control` | label + `CTRL-RAN`, 36 bytes | 0 |
| `step:` + `compose_up: [postgres]` | `dva run viacompose` | **0 bytes** | **0** |
| the same `compose_up` item | `dva provision --dry-run` | `[dry-run] $ docker compose -f … up -d postgres` | 0 |
| `cmd: "echo VIACMD-RAN"` | `dva run viacmd` | **0 bytes** | **0** |
| the same `cmd:` item | `dva provision legacycmd` | `$ echo PROV-CMD-RAN` + its output | 0 |
| `echo: "VIAECHO-SHOWN"` | `dva run viaecho` | **0 bytes** | **0** |
| the same `echo:` item | `dva provision legacyecho` | `PROV-ECHO-SHOWN` | 0 |

Every odd row is the defect; every even row is the control proving the same key works on the
provision path. The `run:` control proves the runner itself executes. Not even the step label
prints in the failing cases.

```yaml
interaction:
  viacompose:
    steps:
      - step: "start db via compose_up"
        compose_up: [postgres]      # dva run viacompose → no output, exit 0
  viacmd:
    steps:
      - cmd: "echo VIACMD-RAN"      # dva run viacmd → no output, exit 0
```

Two substring traps make a naive grep useless here, both hit while measuring this: `ComposeRun`
matches inside `Docker**ComposeRun**ner`, and `.Cmd` matches `r.Cmd`. Match on the qualified field
access (`step.X`), and read the matched line before believing the count.

## Why TASK-083 did not cover this

[TASK-083](../archive/083-a-step-without-run-announces-work-it-never-does.md) made a step with **no payload**
report itself. A `compose_up` item *has* a payload, so `ProvisionItem.IsInert()` correctly returns
false and no notice fires — reporting it as "a label with no run:" would be a false statement
about a config that is legitimate and works elsewhere. The two are the same defect class (silent
no-op, exit 0) with opposite causes: 083 was a config mistake nobody reported, this is a config
*correctness* that one execution path never implemented.

## Proposed fix

Two directions; pick one, do not do both.

1. **Implement the five keys in both runners**, matching `provision.go`'s behaviour. Highest
   fidelity — the same YAML then means the same thing wherever it appears — but it moves compose
   invocation into `internal/runner`, which currently has no compose dependency in `LocalRunner`.
   `echo:` and `cmd:` cost nothing here: they are a print and a shell command, with no new
   dependency at all, so they can land even if the compose keys go the other way.
2. **Reject them at validation time on the interaction path.** If these keys are only meaningful
   under `provision:`, say so: a `validate` error naming the key and the supported location. Cheap
   and honest, but it makes a currently-"valid" config fail, and `schema.json` allows the keys in
   both places because `provision_item` is one definition shared by both.

Direction 1 is the better default — the fixture in
`internal/integration/testdata/fixtures/provision-profiles/dva.yml:27-32` shows the
`step`+`parallel`+`compose_up` shape is intended usage — but 2 is defensible if compose on the
interaction path is genuinely out of scope for the runners.

Whichever is chosen, the deeper question is worth answering once: this is the fourth key-by-key
disagreement between the runner and provision paths ([TASK-086](086-parallel-steps-discard-their-note.md),
[TASK-089](089-note-suppresses-run-on-the-interaction-path-only.md), and this task's two groups).
Reconciling them one key at a time is how the count got to four. A shared step executor would
close the class.

## Non-goals

- Not changing `provision.go`, which already behaves correctly.
- Not touching `IsInert`. These are payloads; the classification is correct — `IsInert` already
  checks `Echo` and `Cmd` explicitly — and TASK-083's tests pin it.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] An interaction step with `compose_up` either runs or is rejected — never silent | verify: `human — run the fixture below; state which direction was chosen` — **direction 1 (implement), chosen by the user. `dva run viacompose` prints `→ start db via compose_up` then `compose up -d postgres`, 50 bytes, exit 0**
- [x] `cmd:` and `echo:` in an interaction step are no longer 0 bytes | verify: `dva run viacmd` and `dva run viaecho` on the fixture — print the byte count of each; both are 0 today — **43 and 28 bytes**
- [x] Both runners agree | verify: `go test ./internal/runner/ -run TestComposeKeysOnInteractionPath` — **12 subtests, the five keys × both runners plus two ordering cases**
- [x] The `run:` control still executes unchanged | verify: `go test ./internal/runner/ -run TestStepWithoutRunIsReported` — must stay at 9 passing subtests — **9, unchanged; one subtest was renamed, see Resolution**
- [x] `provision`'s handling is untouched | verify: `go test ./internal/cli/ -run Provision` — print the count of tests selected, must be non-zero — **39 PASS, 0 FAIL; and all three provision profiles on the fixture print exactly what they printed before**
- [x] Every `examples/*.yml` still validates | verify: `for f in examples/*.yml; do …; done` — print files swept AND failures; expect 16 and 0, with a deliberately broken control proving the sweep can fail — **16 swept, 0 failures; the broken control exits 1 with a parse error, so the sweep can report failure**
- [x] Not vacuous | verify: `human — revert the change and confirm the new test fails` — **reverted the payload test to `len(cmds) == 0` in both runners: 12 subtests failed across `TestComposeKeysOnInteractionPath` and `TestStepWithoutRunIsReported`, while TASK-089's and TASK-091's tests stayed green**
- [x] Full suite passes | verify: `make test` — **all packages ok under `-race`; `internal/runner` coverage 41.1% → 44.5%**

## Resolution

**Direction 1**, chosen by the user: the five keys are implemented in both runners.

The dependency objection in "Proposed fix" turned out not to apply. It assumed compose invocation
would have to be *moved into* `internal/runner`; it is already there, because TASK-091 put
`composeArgv`/`execComposeStep` in `internal/runner/compose.go` — the same package `LocalRunner`
lives in. So the compose keys cost an ordinary intra-package call and no new import.
`internal/cli/compose.go:824 buildComposeArgs` and `internal/runner/compose.go composeArgv` are
the same builder written twice, which is worth knowing but was not resolved here.

`internal/runner/step_keys.go` (new) holds the runner-independent half:

- `hasStepKeys` — does the item carry any of the five payloads
- `runComposeStepKeys` — `compose_up`/`compose_exec`/`compose_run`, returning `handled`
- `runLegacyStepKeys` — `echo:` then `cmd:`

Both runners call all three. Only `run:` stays in the runners, because it is the one key whose
meaning depends on who is executing it: a local shell for `LocalRunner`, `compose exec <service>`
for `DockerComposeRunner`.

The defect itself was one line in each loop. `if len(cmds) == 0 { continue }` treats "no `run:`
commands" as "no work", so a step whose payload was any of the five was discarded *before its
label printed*. It is now `if len(cmds) == 0 && !hasStepKeys(step)`. A note-only step still falls
through to `continue`, which is what TASK-089's tests pin.

Ordering follows `provision.go` exactly and is covered by its own subtests: a compose key
short-circuits the whole item (provision.go `return`s after each), and otherwise `run:` executes
before `echo:` prints.

Measured on the rebuilt binary — every failing row was **0 bytes** before:

| invocation | bytes | output | exit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dva run control` (control) | 36 | `→ control: modern run key` + `CTRL-RAN` | 0 |
| `dva run viacompose` | **50** | `→ start db via compose_up` + `compose up -d postgres` | 0 |
| `dva run viaexec` | **46** | `→ wait for db` + `compose exec pg_isready -U app` | 0 |
| `dva run viarun` | **34** | `→ one-off` + `compose run migrate up` | 0 |
| `dva run viacmd` | **43** | `→ step 1` + `$ echo VIACMD-RAN` + `VIACMD-RAN` | 0 |
| `dva run viaecho` | **28** | `→ step 1` + `VIAECHO-SHOWN` | 0 |

The compose command in the fixture is `echo`, so those rows are the argv that would have gone to
docker, printed rather than executed.

### A test whose premise this inverted

`TestStepWithoutRunIsReported` (TASK-083) had a subtest named *"an item whose payload these runners
do not handle is not reported"*. Its assertion — compose_up is a payload, so no inert notice fires
— is still correct and is unchanged. Its *name* was a statement about the defect, and the defect
is gone, so it is now "a compose_up item is a payload, not an inert label" and additionally
asserts that the step runs.

That subtest also caught something worth recording: it had been passing a **nil config**, harmless
while the runners ignored `compose_up`. The moment they stopped ignoring it, the unit test shelled
out to a real `docker compose up -d postgres` (it failed with "no configuration file provided",
so nothing happened). It now uses the `echo` stand-in like every other test here. A unit test that
silently gains the ability to contact a daemon is a hazard the change itself created.

## Reproduction fixture

```yaml
version: "0.1.44"
interaction:
  control:
    steps:
      - step: "control: modern run key"
        run: "echo CTRL-RAN"
  viacompose:
    steps:
      - step: "start db via compose_up"
        compose_up: [postgres]
  viacmd:
    steps:
      - cmd: "echo VIACMD-RAN"
  viaecho:
    steps:
      - echo: "VIAECHO-SHOWN"
provision:
  default:
    - step: "start db via compose_up"
      compose_up: [postgres]
  legacycmd:
    - cmd: "echo PROV-CMD-RAN"
  legacyecho:
    - echo: "PROV-ECHO-SHOWN"
```

Each `dva run` target above produces 0 bytes and exit 0 except `control`. Each `dva provision`
profile carrying the same key works. Same keys, same file.
