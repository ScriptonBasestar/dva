  Boolean, default false. Omitted/false keeps advisory [warn] + exit 0; required:true promotes

  not gain required. Wait:false still skips the readiness path entirely.

  Focused tests re-run, counted under -v: config `TestValidateApplicationHealthRequiredContract`
  5 `=== RUN` subtests / 5 `--- PASS` / 0 FAIL, ok; lifecycle `TestStartAppsHealthRequiredContract`
  5 RUN / 5 PASS / 0 FAIL, ok (6.59s). Neither is vacuous: the lifecycle test asserts a non-nil
  error plus `[FAIL]` and the *absence* of the advisory line for required:true, and asserts the
  byte-exact warn line exactly once for omitted/false.
  Independent CLI QA with ./bin/dva (v0.1.44), fresh fixtures under the scratchpad, exit code read
  from $? directly (no pipe), health `command: "exit 1"` with timeout/ready_timeout 1 so it fails
  in ~1s: omitted UP_EXIT=0 + one `[warn] app sleeper not ready after 1s`; required:false UP_EXIT=0
  + one `[warn]`; required:true UP_EXIT=1 + `[FAIL] app sleeper not ready after 1s` + `ERROR: app
  sleeper not ready after 1s`; required:true with a passing probe UP_EXIT=0 and no not-ready line.
  `dva app down sleeper` returned 0 in all four; pgrep found no leftover `sleep 30`; `git status
  --porcelain` is empty.
  Scope guard verified independently, not just via the test: `dva validate` on top-level
  `health_checks.redis.required: true` exits 1 with "health_checks.redis: Additional property
  required is not allowed"; `applications.sleeper.health.required: "yes"` exits 1 with "Invalid
  type. Expected: boolean, given: string"; `required: true` on an application validates EXIT 0.
  The `dva up` path (not only `dva app up`) also carries it: same reqtrue fixture, `dva up`
  EXIT=1; omitted fixture `dva up` EXIT=0 — errors.Join at internal/cli/compose.go:256.
  No open task in tasks/todo, tasks/blocked, tasks/decision, tasks/plan (incl. TASK-134..152)
  references TASK-118, health.required, or app readiness exit codes.

# Task 118: the one readiness branch TASK-117 deliberately left alone

## What was decided in TASK-117, and what was not

[TASK-117](117-startapps-prints-fail-and-returns-nil.md) made the three `[FAIL]`
branches of `startWave` reach `errors.Join`, so a readiness failure now sets the exit code.
It left one sibling branch untouched:

```go
} else {
	fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "[warn] app %s not ready after %s\n", name, timeout)
}
```

That branch fires when the health check did not pass **and the process is still alive**. It
prints a warning, appends nothing, and the command exits 0.

## Why it was not swept in

The original write-up justified leaving it with "turning it into an error would change
behaviour for anyone relying on `wait: false` semantics." **That reason is wrong** and should
not be reused: the enclosing goroutine returns at `if !opts.Wait { return }` well before this
point, so `wait: false` never reaches it. This branch only runs when the user explicitly
asked DVA to wait for readiness.

The reason that does hold is narrower. DVA cannot distinguish "slow to warm up" from "broken"
from this signal alone — the process is running, it just has not answered the probe yet. And
the genuinely-broken shape has a sharper detector right below it: the port-ownership check,
which now errors.

## The hole that leaves

An app that **binds its port** but **never passes its health check** is caught by neither.
Port ownership is satisfied, so the check below stays quiet; the process is alive, so this
branch only warns. `dva up` exits 0 with a `[warn]` and an application that is up but not
serving.

That is a real gap, not a hypothetical. It is filed here rather than fixed because promoting
it changes the exit code of every existing project with a flaky or slow probe — a product
decision about what `dva up` promises, not a defect to correct unilaterally.

## The decision to make

1. **Keep it a warning.** `dva up` means "started", not "ready". Simple, and no existing setup
   breaks. Leaves the bind-but-never-healthy app reporting success.
2. **Promote it to an error.** `dva up` means "ready", consistent with the fact that the user
   set a timeout and asked to wait. Breaks CI for anyone whose probe is slower than their
   configured `ready_timeout`.
3. **Make it configurable** — e.g. `health.required: true` per application, defaulting to
   today's warning. Preserves both, at the cost of one more knob and a migration story for
   people who would rather have had option 2 by default.

Option 3 is the only one that does not force a choice on existing users, and it is also the
one that adds surface area to a config file the project's own guardrails try to keep small.
That trade-off is the decision.

## Recommendation (recorded for the human decision, not yet confirmed)

**C — configurable, defaulting to today's warning.** Add `health.required: bool` (default
`false`) on the application's health-check config; when `true`, the `[warn] app %s not ready`
branch calls `recordErr` exactly as the three sibling `[FAIL]` branches TASK-117 fixed do, so
the run exits non-zero. When `false`/absent, behaviour is byte-for-byte today.

The reasoning, for the human to confirm or override:

- This branch is reached **only when the user already opted in to waiting** (`if !opts.Wait { return }`
  gates it at `app_manager.go:181-183`). So whoever hits it asked DVA to confirm readiness — that
  is the audience option 2 protects. But option 2 makes the choice for every project at once, and
  a probe slower than `ready_timeout` is a common, non-broken condition. C lets the opt-in that
  already exists at `Wait` extend one level deeper, to per-app strictness, without breaking the
  default.
- It is the only option that does not regress an existing caller. Option 1 keeps the bind-but-
  never-healthy app reporting success — the gap this task exists to name. Option 2 closes the gap
  by changing the default exit code for every project with a slow probe.
- The "one more knob" cost is real but bounded: it sits beside `ready_timeout`, which is already a
  per-app health knob, so it does not open a new category of config so much as complete one.

If the human picks C, the change is: `Required bool` on `HealthCheckConfig` (`config.go:217`),
honoured in the `else` arm at `app_manager.go:218-229`, one test in `app_start_exit_test.go`, and
a USAGE.md line stating `dva up` means "started" unless `health.required: true` opts into "ready".

If the human picks 1 or 2 instead, this recommendation is wrong and the implementation differs —
hence the recorded recommendation rather than code.

## Decision confirmed: C

**Chosen: C — opt-in strict readiness via `applications.*.health.required` Boolean, default `false`, application/variant only.**

Confirmed and implemented. Default remains advisory (exit 0 + `[warn]`); projects that want
`dva app up` to mean "ready" set `health.required: true`. Top-level `health_checks` does **not**
support `required` (scope guard).

### Implementation paths (4 commits)

| Commit | Scope | Files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `a653ca7` feat(config): add required application health contract | config + schema + contract test | `internal/config/config.go`, `internal/config/schema.json`, `internal/config/health_required_schema_test.go` |
| `7c16ebc` fix(lifecycle): fail required application readiness timeout | lifecycle else-arm + contract test | `internal/lifecycle/app_manager.go`, `internal/lifecycle/app_health_required_test.go` |
| `c5ea2d6` docs(config): document required application readiness | docs + generated library | `USAGE.md`, `skills/config/references/schema-reference.md`, `internal/cli/library_reference.txt` |
| c3232b9 docs(tasks): close TASK-118 | this file move only | `tasks/done/118-a-health-check-that-never-passes-is-still-exit-0.md` |

Behaviour in `startWave` alive/not-ready else arm:

- `app.Health.Required == false` (omitted/zero): `[warn] app %s not ready after %s` — exit 0
- `app.Health.Required == true`: `[FAIL] app %s not ready after %s` + `recordErr` — non-zero
- `Wait: false`: readiness path skipped entirely (unchanged)

**Focused tests**

> **Retired by the command-surface restructure (`docs/43`).** `applications:` was removed, and

> the historical record of what passed on 2026-08-03; they are written apart from executable

> kept verbatim so `git log -S` can still find what ran.
>
> **The feature itself is gone, not merely its tests.** The plan surface has no equivalent of

- [TASK-117](117-startapps-prints-fail-and-returns-nil.md) — fixed the three sibling
  branches; this is the one it left, and the comment in the code points here.
- [TASK-113](../archive/113-up-and-app-commands-swallow-unknown-flags.md) — the same recurring
  shape: DVA reaches the right conclusion and then does not let it reach the exit code.
