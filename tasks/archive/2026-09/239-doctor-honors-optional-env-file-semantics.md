# Task 239: make doctor honor optional env file semantics

## Problem

The environment loader skips a missing `required: false` file, but doctor flattens declarations to
paths and reports every missing file as a failed built-in check. `dva doctor --strict` therefore
rejects configurations that the runtime intentionally accepts.

## Completion criteria

- [x] Normalized env-file access preserves each path's required flag while path-only callers keep their existing contract | verify: `go test ./internal/config -run TestAllEnvFileConfigsPreservesRequiredMetadata`
- [x] Doctor omits missing optional files, fails missing required or inaccessible files, and reports existing optional and required files as passing | verify: `go test ./internal/cli -run 'TestDoctorEnvFiles|TestDoctorOptionalEnvFile|TestDoctorFailRow'`
- [x] User documentation and the changelog describe required-only missing-file diagnostics | verify: `make doc-check`
- [x] Repository gates pass before integration | verify: `make lint && make test && make test-integration && make commit-check`

## Decision

Keep missing optional files out of the result set rather than rendering a misleading passing
"exists" assertion. Preserve the existing stable result name for files that exist and for missing
required files. Only errors classified by `os.IsNotExist` are allowed optional-file omissions;
other access errors remain failures because the runtime loader also rejects them. Project
configurations must not create placeholder secrets or change optional files to required merely to
silence doctor.
