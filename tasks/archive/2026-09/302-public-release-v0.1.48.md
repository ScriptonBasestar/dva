# Task 302: publish DVA v0.1.48

## Decision

Publish `v0.1.48` as the next minor after `v0.1.47`. This ships Stage A of the interaction
`env_file` deprecation, the env-bridge commands gated at `EnvBridgeIntroducedVersion`,
capability-driven init, and cross-project plan composition. `MinScaffoldVersion` remains
`0.1.44`. Do not include the `kubectl` top-level reserved-name promotion (TASK-255/256).

Publication is an explicit external write. Use the documented manual runbook from a clean
detached worktree at the integrated release commit. The credential is supplied only to the
release command; never record its value, a Keychain result, or an authorization header in
this task, a commit, or logs retained as evidence. Do not move, recreate, or separately
push a tag to recover a partial publication.

## Completion criteria

- [x] Integrate the reviewed release preparation into `master`, push it, and record one immutable
  `release_commit` equal to the local and remote source tip | verify: human — integration evidence
  must name only the commit, not credential material
- [x] Create a local lightweight `v0.1.48` tag at `release_commit`; use a clean detached worktree
  at that exact identity | verify: `test "$(git cat-file -t v0.1.48)" = commit && test "$(git rev-list -n1 v0.1.48)" = "$RELEASE_COMMIT"`
- [x] Record the reviewed `release-notes/v0.1.48.md` SHA-256 and pass `make release-preflight`
  with the approved command-scoped credential | verify: human — preflight output must say no remote
  state was created and must not retain credential values
- [x] Publish once through pinned GoReleaser with the reviewed release notes; if remote state is
  created, recover only at the same immutable tag and commit | verify: human — external publication
  requires final remote evidence
- [x] Run `make release-clean` and `make release-postflight`; record the final URL, remote tag and
  Release identity, exact seven assets, checksum verification, source push, and local cleanup | verify: human — postflight evidence must omit credential values

## Publication evidence

The immutable release commit is `40a35f8f79031f4ddb02c7317f8c8c461684901b`. It was
integrated and pushed as `master` before publication; the remote lightweight `v0.1.48`
tag and the GitHub Release `targetCommitish` both resolve to that same commit.

The reviewed release notes digest is
`3930315cbc83b39734b59f4f91391d185cdc5e59ab017e7595eac3de3910ee4c` (SHA-256).
`make release-preflight` printed `preflight passed for v0.1.48 at 40a35f8f79031f4ddb02c7317f8c8c461684901b; no remote state was created`.
Pinned GoReleaser `2.12.7` published once from a clean detached worktree at that tag.
`make release-clean` then `make release-postflight` passed for the exact seven assets.
No credential value, credential lookup, request header, or shell environment is retained here.

This identity does **not** include the later `kubectl` reserved-name promotion
(`a534681` and after). That work remains on `master` for a subsequent minor.

The final, non-draft, non-prerelease release is
<https://github.com/ScriptonBasestar/dva/releases/tag/v0.1.48>. Postflight confirmed
exactly these seven assets:

```text
checksums.txt
dva_darwin_amd64.tar.gz
dva_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
dva_linux_amd64.tar.gz
dva_linux_arm64.tar.gz
dva_windows_amd64.zip
dva_windows_arm64.zip
```

## Non-goals

- No `kubectl` route registration.
- No TASK-266 Stage B schema rejection.
- No `MinScaffoldVersion` bump.
