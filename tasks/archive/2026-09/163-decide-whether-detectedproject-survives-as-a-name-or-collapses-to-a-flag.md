# Task 163: The deferred `detectedProject` simplification

## Decision: **C — keep the name and record why**

`detectedProject` stays a **project name string**, not a "running" boolean.

### Why not B (boolean)

When `project_name:` is **absent** from dva.yml:

1. `ComposeArgv` omits `--project-name` (compose infers from directory).
2. Detection reads the **actual** project name from the running container.
3. That name reaches exec only via `detectedProject` → `composeArgv` `projectOverride`.

A boolean would preserve "is up" and drop "which project", breaking
`TestProjectNameUsesDetectionWhenConfigDeclaresNone`.

When `project_name:` **is** declared, the string often matches config and looks
redundant — that is harmless. One field covers both cases.

### What would make B correct later

Resolve an effective project name once at load/detect, then let detection be
boolean *against that name*. That is a resolve-pipeline change, not a P4 field trim.

### Evidence

Comments on `DockerComposeRunner.detectedProject` and `composeArgv` projectOverride
document the undeclared-`project_name` path. No behaviour change.

```
go test ./internal/runner/ -run ProjectName -count=1
```
