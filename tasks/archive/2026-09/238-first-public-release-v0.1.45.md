# Task 238: prepare and publish the first public v0.1.45 release

## Supersession

TASK-241 supersedes this publication target with `v0.1.46`. The local lightweight `v0.1.45` tag
remains immutable at `39019d1e12b1fb131ed773abde18ce7726f44e08`; its six-platform and real
release-mode artifact evidence below remains valid historical evidence. No remote `v0.1.45` tag,
draft, or release was created. Optional env-file doctor semantics and the corrected bare lifecycle
public contract were integrated after that tag, so the first public release candidate advances
rather than moving or deleting the frozen tag.

## Decision

Release `v0.1.45` instead of retrying the unpublished `v0.1.44` candidate. The old local tag stays
at its original commit and is never deleted, moved, or pushed. No remote DVA tag or GitHub release
exists at task creation. The new candidate includes the post-tag validator corrections and the
effective default-plan output contract used to verify the completed DVA waves.

`MinScaffoldVersion` remains `0.1.44`: this patch release changes CLI observability and validation,
not the minimum configuration syntax emitted by `dva init`. Only `config.Version` advances to
`0.1.45`.

Public release publication remains a separate external write. It is not authorized by approval of
local preparation alone. Before publication, a human must confirm that the active fine-grained
token has **Contents: read/write**, and the remote tag/release absence probes must be repeated.

## Release identity and retry policy

The release commit is the clean, integrated `master` tip that passes every repository and
six-platform gate. Create a local lightweight `v0.1.45` tag at exactly that commit, do not push the
tag separately, and validate real release-mode artifacts with `--skip=publish`. Once remote state
exists, recovery stays on that exact tag and commit; never retag a newer commit to conceal a failed
attempt. `.goreleaser.yml` retains `target_commitish`, existing-draft reuse, artifact replacement,
and delayed publication so an interrupted upload can be resumed without moving the tag.

## Completion criteria

- [x] Set runtime version `0.1.45` while preserving scaffold floor `0.1.44` | verify: `go run ./tools/releasecheck version --tag v0.1.45 && test "$(/usr/bin/grep -Fxc 'const MinScaffoldVersion = "0.1.44"' internal/config/version.go)" -eq 1`
- [x] Re-run repository and six-platform release gates at the exact release commit | verify: `dva lint && dva test && dva test integration && make test-skill-dogfood && make doc-check && make commit-check && mise exec -- make release-check`
- [x] Validate a local lightweight tag and real release-mode artifacts without publishing | verify: `test "$(git cat-file -t v0.1.45)" = commit && go run ./tools/releasecheck version --tag "$(git describe --tags --exact-match)" && mise exec -- goreleaser release --skip=publish --clean && go run ./tools/releasecheck artifacts --dist dist`
- [ ] Confirm GitHub write authorization and absence of conflicting remote state immediately before publication | verify: `test -n "$GITHUB_TOKEN" && test -z "$(git ls-remote --tags origin refs/tags/v0.1.45)" && gh release list --repo ScriptonBasestar/dva --limit 100 --json tagName | jq -e 'all(.[]; .tagName != "v0.1.45")'`
- [ ] Publish through pinned GoReleaser and prove the remote tag, final release, six archives, and checksum asset all match the release identity | verify: human — external publication requires explicit authorization and post-write evidence
- [ ] Add pinned-module and checksum-verifying binary installation documentation only after public assets exist | verify: human — documentation must not advertise assets before publication
- [ ] Record the release URL, artifact checksums, checks, push state, and final probes; remove local `dist/` before archiving | verify: `test ! -e dist`

## Local preparation evidence

The release identity is commit `39019d1e12b1fb131ed773abde18ce7726f44e08`. That exact clean
commit passed lint, race/coverage tests, integration tests, skill dogfood, documentation and commit
gates, and the six-platform snapshot gate. The preserved historical `v0.1.44` tag initially exposed
a snapshot-version drift: GoReleaser chose the nearest tag while the repository contract used only
an exact tag. The release commit fixes that mismatch by passing the exact-tag-aware version into
GoReleaser; its untagged snapshot was `0.0.0-SNAPSHOT-39019d1`.

After integration, the local lightweight `v0.1.45` tag was created at that same commit. The tagged
snapshot reported `0.1.45-SNAPSHOT-39019d1`. Real release mode with `--skip=publish` produced six
platform archives and six matching checksum entries; its metadata and host binary reported exact
version `0.1.45` and the full release commit. Post-build probes still found no remote `v0.1.45` tag
or GitHub release. Generated `dist/` and `bin/` directories were removed after verification.

This evidence commit advances `master` beyond the fixed release identity. Any future publication
must therefore use a new clean detached worktree at local tag `v0.1.45`, restore the recorded
release commit above, and require `HEAD == v0.1.45 == release_commit` before invoking GoReleaser.
Do not publish from the newer `master` tip and do not move the tag.

## Preserved history

TASK-237 records the earlier `v0.1.44` local artifact validation and the GitHub `403` response. Its
local tag remains at `49d444cc8f4fb128c61b00f6789b577545bc7a21`; post-failure probes found no
remote tag, draft, or published release. That evidence is retained rather than rewritten as a
successful or deleted attempt.
