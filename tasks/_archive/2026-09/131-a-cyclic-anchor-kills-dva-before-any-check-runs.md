verification-summary: |
  Built the cyclic fixture from scratch in three shapes (interaction subcommand alias,
  stack entry alias, and a cycle hidden behind `<<: *loop`) plus one inside an imported
  module file. All four are rejected: exit 1, 3 stderr lines, zero `fatal error`/`goroutine
  stack exceeds` markers, message naming both anchor and YAML path. No hang — every run
  returned well inside `timeout 20`.
  Billion-laughs (12 levels x 9 fanout): yaml.v3's own limit fires first —
  `ERROR: invalid YAML syntax: yaml: document contains excessive aliasing`, exit 1,
  0.01s real, 14.7 MB peak RSS. A 100k-deep acyclic document hits `exceeded max depth of
  10000` in the parser before checkAnchorCycles runs, so the new walk's own recursion is
  bounded by construction.
  Criterion 2 verified without touching the repo: `go test -overlay` swapping in a stubbed
  anchor_cycle.go. Mutation caught (exit 1) as a runtime fatal with no `--- FAIL`
  attribution — exactly the caveat the task recorded, not a cleaner result than claimed.
  Per TASK-144 I counted `=== RUN`/`--- PASS`/`--- FAIL` on both runs rather than trusting
  the `ok` line.

# Task 131: Decide how a self-referencing anchor is rejected

## The blind spot

A `dva.yml` whose `interaction:` tree contains a self-referencing anchor terminates the process
with `fatal error: stack overflow` during config load. Every entry point that reads config is
affected, and none of them get to run a single check.

```yaml
interaction:
  loop: &loop
    command: echo hi
    subcommands:
      self: *loop
```

| command | exit | stderr |
|---|---|---|
| `dva validate` | **2** | `runtime: goroutine stack exceeds 1000000000-byte limit` |
| `dva doctor` | **2** | same |
| `dva run loop` | **2** | same |

~508 stderr lines and `...2340902 frames elided...` — both are samples of one run, not constants.

Two properties make this worse than an ugly error message:

1. **It is a `fatal error:`, not a `panic:`** — grepped for `^(panic|fatal error):`, matched
   `fatal error: stack overflow`. Go's runtime throws it; it is not panicked. **No `recover()`
   anywhere up the stack can contain it**, so the defense cannot be a deferred recover in
   `loadFile` and must happen *before* decode.
2. **DVA already has a check for exactly this shape and it can never run.**
   `MaxSubcommandDepth = 5` (`validate_warnings.go:762`) works correctly — on a deep-but-acyclic
   fixture `dva validate` prints `interaction.alpha: nested 6 levels deep (max 5)` and exits 0.
   It is a post-decode check, so on the input that most needs a depth bound the process is already
   dead.

## The mechanism

The recursion cycle, read off the trace (`(*InteractionCommand).UnmarshalYAML` appears **7 times**
in the un-elided head alone):

```
(*decoder).mappingStruct
  → (*decoder).unmarshal
    → (*Node).Decode                                  ← resets the cycle guard here
      → (*InteractionCommand).UnmarshalYAML           ← internal/config, config.go:383
        → (*decoder).callUnmarshaler
          → (*decoder).unmarshal
            → (*decoder).mappingStruct  → ...
```

yaml.v3 **does** guard against cyclic anchors (`decode.go:534-538`):

```go
if d.aliases[n] {
    failf("anchor '%s' value contains itself", n.Value)
}
d.aliases[n] = true
```

but that set lives on the decoder, and `(*Node).Decode` in `yaml.go` opens with `d := newDecoder()`
— and `newDecoder` does `d.aliases = make(map[*Node]bool)` (`decode.go:346`). So every re-entry
through a custom unmarshaler hands the walk a **fresh, empty** alias set. The guard is walk-scoped
by design (note the `delete(d.aliases, n)` after recursing); it was never built to survive
re-entry. It therefore never fires, and the recursion is unbounded.

The trigger is one field. `InteractionCommand.UnmarshalYAML` decodes into a local `plain` alias
under this comment (`config.go:388-389`):

```go
// Decode all non-command fields using the tag-based alias.
// We use a plain alias that has no UnmarshalYAML to avoid recursion.
```

True of the outer struct. False of the field that matters — `plain.Subcommands` at `:403` is
`map[string]*InteractionCommand`, still the custom-unmarshaler-bearing type. Dropping a method
from a type does not drop it from that type's fields, so `node.Decode(&p)` re-enters
`UnmarshalYAML` immediately. The comment names the hazard it does not actually avoid.

## Why this is ours, not upstream

Three shapes, one document, one library version (v3.0.1), each in its own process:

| decoded into | result |
|---|---|
| `yaml.Node` | `err=<nil>`, DocumentNode, 1 child — **survives** |
| plain struct, no `UnmarshalYAML` anywhere | `yaml: anchor 'loop' value contains itself` — **clean error** |
| custom `UnmarshalYAML` whose `plain` alias keeps the custom field type | **stack overflow** |

The library's guard works. DVA's unmarshaler is what defeats it. And `gopkg.in/yaml.v3 v3.0.1` is
the newest published version (checked against the module proxy: only `v3.0.0` and `v3.0.1` exist),
so there is no upgrade to wait for regardless.

The `yaml.Node` row is the important one: it proves a **pre-decode Node-tree walk is feasible**,
because parsing the same bytes into a `Node` does not recurse into user types at all.

**Blast radius: 1 of 7.** `internal/` has 7 `UnmarshalYAML` implementations; checking each struct
body for a field of its own type, only `InteractionCommand` is self-referential
(`Subcommands map[string]*InteractionCommand`). It is reachable from `interaction:`
(`config.go:22`) and nested `subcommands:` (`:323`) — not from `stack:` or `applications:`.

## What this corrects in TASK-125

[TASK-125](../archive/125-three-interaction-warnings-stop-at-depth-1.md) §"Why the walker needs no
cycle guard" (`:130-142`) recorded three things that measurement contradicts:

| TASK-125 said | measured |
|---|---|
| "the **panic** trace" | `fatal error: stack overflow` — not a panic; `recover()` is not an option |
| "with **no `internal/config` frame**" | **18** `internal/config` frames; `(*InteractionCommand).UnmarshalYAML` is named in the trace and is the frame driving the recursion |
| "it is **upstream** of every check in this file" | a plain struct on the same version returns a clean error; the crash needs DVA's own unmarshaler |

**Its conclusion still holds.** `eachInteractionNode` and `calculateSubcommandDepth` (verified
unguarded — no depth cap, no visited set) really are safe today, because decode never yields a
cyclic `Config`. The reasoning was wrong; the result was right.

That distinction is not bookkeeping — it is a constraint on this task. Two of the options below
preserve "decode never yields a cycle"; any option that instead *tolerates* shared anchors would
invalidate TASK-125's conclusion and require adding cycle guards to both walkers in the same
change. **Whoever picks the fix owns that coupling.**

## Options

- **A — Pre-decode `yaml.Node` cycle scan in `loadFile` (`config.go:932`).** Parse to a `Node`
  (proven to survive), walk for a node reachable from itself, reject with an error naming the
  anchor and its YAML path. Type-independent: covers all 7 unmarshalers and any self-referential
  type added later. Cost: a second parse per config file, plus a new walk to maintain.
- **B — Retype `plain.Subcommands` to a shadow type without `UnmarshalYAML`.** Restores yaml.v3's
  own guard, so the clean `anchor 'loop' value contains itself` error comes for free with no new
  code path. Cost: the custom unmarshaler's *only* job is `command:` polymorphism — scalar vs
  sequence (`config.go:437-461`) — so a naive shadow type silently drops list-form `command:`
  inside `subcommands:`. It would have to re-implement that, and nothing currently proves it wrong
  if it doesn't.
- **C — Thread a depth counter through the unmarshaler.** `UnmarshalYAML(node *yaml.Node) error`
  has a fixed signature, so depth has to live off-band — a package-level var (not
  concurrency-safe) or a receiver field set by the parent. Bounds the damage without diagnosing
  the cause, and reports a depth error for what is really a cycle.
- **D — Accept and document.** It takes a hand-written self-referencing anchor to trigger; no user
  reaches it by accident.

## Recommendation: A

A is the only option that is not tied to one type. B is cheaper and fixes today's single instance,
but it leaves the next self-referential type to rediscover this from a stack trace, and it trades a
crash for a possible silent loss of list-form `command:` in subcommands. A is also the only option
that can name the anchor and its path, which is the difference between an error a user can act on
and one they can only report.

A and B both preserve TASK-125's conclusion. C weakens the diagnosis. D leaves a
`fatal error` reachable from a config file.

## The cost that needs deciding with it

Whatever is chosen needs a test asserting a **clean error** on the cyclic fixture — and per
TASK-116's standard, one that fails when the fix is reverted. That test cannot simply call the
loader in-process today: an unfixed loader takes the test binary down with it rather than failing
an assertion, so the red half has to run the fixture through a subprocess. After the fix the
in-process form works, which means the mutation check and the shipped test are not the same shape.

`internal/config/` currently has **no test at all** for cyclic or self-referential anchors, so
there is nothing to extend and nothing to break.

## Resolution

Option A. `checkAnchorCycles` (`internal/config/anchor_cycle.go`) walks the parsed `yaml.Node`
tree before any config type sees it and rejects a node reachable from itself, naming the anchor
and the path where the loop closes.

Implementation turned up two things the analysis above did not have.

**`loadFile` was the wrong place, and this task said to put it there.** Option A names
`loadFile` (`config.go:932`) as the site. `VerifyMigrated` (`migrate.go:91`) also decoded raw
user bytes into config types — through its own `yaml.Unmarshal`, not through `loadFile` — so a
guard in `loadFile` would have left `dva config migrate` crashing on exactly the input the
migration exists to repair. Both now go through one `decodeConfig`, and that choke point, not
`loadFile`, is what the guard defends. Measured on a legacy compose fixture carrying a
self-referencing anchor: `dva config migrate .` exits 1 with **3 lines** and **0** `fatal error`/
`goroutine` markers, the source file is left unwritten, and the guard's message arrives wrapped in
migrate's own "nothing was written" framing.

**Reachability is not a cycle.** A first cut that rejected any node seen twice would reject
`<<: *base` and every shared anchor — valid YAML that this repo's own examples use. The walk is
therefore three-colour: a node is marked on-path while its subtree is being walked and cleared
afterwards, so only a node that is *its own ancestor* is an error. The cleared mark is also what
keeps the walk proportional to the nodes rather than to the expansion; without it a document
that aliases one anchor from many places takes longer to check than to run.

### Where the guard is not

Four decode paths still bypass `decodeConfig`: `MigrateLegacyCompose`, `Config.Validate`,
`validateCanonicalOrder`, and `readComposeNameKey`. None of them crash on the cyclic fixture, and
they do not for two different reasons — `Validate` decodes into `any`, which carries no custom
unmarshaler to reset yaml.v3's own guard, so the library's `anchor '...' value contains itself`
fires there; the others never reach `InteractionCommand`. That is a property of today's code, not
a guarantee, so `TestCyclicAnchorSurvivesTheDecodesThatBypassDecodeConfig` pins all four: if any
of them starts recursing, it takes the test binary down and the gate fails.

### The subprocess this task predicted is not needed

"The cost that needs deciding with it" states the red half of the mutation has to run through a
subprocess, because an unfixed loader takes the test binary down rather than failing an assertion.
Measured, that is wrong about the *detection* and right about the *attribution*. With
`checkAnchorCycles` stubbed to `return nil`, `go test ./internal/config/` exits **1** — the
mutation is caught in-process, no subprocess involved. But it is caught as `fatal error: stack
overflow`: **538** lines of runtime dump, **2** stack-overflow marker lines, and the trace names
`config.go:413 (*InteractionCommand).UnmarshalYAML → (*Node).Decode`, the exact mechanism this
task diagnosed. Because a fatal crash aborts the whole package, there is no `--- FAIL: TestX`
attribution and no other result in that run is trustworthy. The shipped tests are in-process, and
the mutation evidence is the crash rather than an assertion — recorded here because reading only
the exit code would suggest a cleanliness the failure does not have.

## Acceptance criteria

| # | criterion | measured |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The cyclic fixture is rejected with an error naming the anchor and its path | `dva validate` exits **1** with 3 lines: `anchor 'entry' contains itself at stack.compose.self` — was ~508 lines of `fatal error` |
| 2 | The test fails when the fix is reverted (TASK-116) | stub `checkAnchorCycles` → `return nil`: package exits **1**, 538 lines, 2 stack-overflow markers; restored → **7 tests / 11 subtests PASS** |
| 3 | Shared anchors and `<<:` merge keys still load and still resolve | fixture aliasing one anchor from 3 places: `dva run two --dry-run` exits 0 and prints `Service: web`, i.e. the merge took effect |
| 4 | Deep-but-acyclic nesting is unaffected and still warns | exits **0** with `nested 6 levels deep (max 5)` intact — the check TASK-125 added still runs |
| 5 | No false positive across the shipped corpus | **19/19** `examples/` configs exit 0; a deliberately cyclic control in the same loop exits 1, so the loop is live |
| 6 | `dva config migrate` no longer crashes on the input it exists to repair | exits **1**, 3 lines, **0** fatal markers, file unwritten |
| 7 | Four gates | `make test` (240 test funcs in `internal/config`, `-race`), `make lint`, `make doc-check`, `make check-generate` — all exit 0 |
| 8 | TASK-125's conclusion is preserved | decode still never yields a cyclic `Config`, so `eachInteractionNode`/`calculateSubcommandDepth` stay correct unguarded; no cycle guard was added to either walker |

Criterion 3 is the one the design exists for. A guard that rejected shared anchors would pass
criteria 1, 2 and 6 while breaking valid configs, and would also invalidate criterion 8.

⚠️ Criterion 3 is met as literally measured, but its wording — "still resolve" — is broader than
its evidence. `Service: web` reaches the struct through `node.Decode(&p)`, which honours `<<:`.
The one field `InteractionCommand.UnmarshalYAML` recovers by hand is `command:`, and that manual
scan compares literal key names, so a `command:` inherited through a merge key is dropped and
the interaction runs nothing at exit 0. Measured at `1695f9d`: `dva run three` (plain alias)
prints `hello`; `dva run two` (`<<: *base`) prints nothing, rc 0, while `Description:` merges
normally. Pre-existing — introduced by `f2c3e95` (2026-04-02) and outside this task's declared
scope, which leaves `InteractionCommand.UnmarshalYAML` as-is. Tracked as
[TASK-162](../todo/162-a-command-inherited-through-a-merge-key-is-dropped-and-the-run-exits-0.md).
