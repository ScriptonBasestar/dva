verification-summary: |
  Built a fresh dva.yml fixture (build+status reserved-name interactions, plus app:build
  namespaced and a build.subcommands.fast) and drove ./bin/dva directly, not just go test.
  Confirmed the manifest's usage_example ('dva run build'/'dva run status'/'dva run build fast')
  is exactly the invocation that prints the declared interaction's own output (exit 0), while the
  bare forms ('dva build', 'dva status', 'dva build fast') dispatch to the built-in instead —
  the defect this task fixed. dva ls text/--json carry the same shadowed_by_builtin mark. All 3
  named clauses appear in one sorted warning (app:build, build, status), and severity is exactly
  as documented: validate/config validate exit 1, ls/manifest/run exit 0. All 8 named cli tests
  and both config tests pass; all 3 required grep counts are 0.

# Task 076: Do not advertise an interaction that the advertised command will not run

## Problem

An `interaction:` key colliding with a built-in was described four different ways, none a
superset of the others. `dva manifest` — the LLM-facing document — emitted `build` under both
`static_commands` and `dynamic_commands`, the latter carrying `usage_example: "dva build"` with
no marker and exit 0. `usage_example` promises that running it invokes the entry it sits inside,
and `dva build` was the one form that did not. `dva ls` had the same shape for a human reader,
and the load-time warning called the interaction ignored, which is false.

## Resolution

`cli.Execute` rewrites `dva <name>` → `dva run <name>` only when name is not a built-in, so
the accurate statement is **shadowing**, not being ignored — the declaration survives and
`dva run <name>` reaches it. Two predicates now carry that:

- `config.ShadowedByBuiltin(name, cmd)` — does the bare form reach this interaction?
- `config.ConflictAdvice(name)` — what happened, and the way out.

`ValidateReservedCommands` calls the first and `Validate` calls the second, so the validator and
the surfaces that describe a conflict cannot disagree again.

### The kinds of conflict, measured against `bin/dva` 0.1.44

| `interaction:` key | `validate` | bare `dva <key>` | `dva run <key>` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `build` + `command:` (hookable) | 1 | built-in runs | **interaction runs** |
| `status` + `command:` (not hookable) | 1 | built-in runs (`DVA v0.1.44`) | **interaction runs** |
| `build` + `replace:` (hook form) | **0** | dispatches to the hook, not the compose build | interaction runs |
| `build fast` (sub of either parent) | as parent | built-in runs, `fast` ignored | **subcommand runs** |
| `app:build` (reserved prefix) | 1 | not a built-in → 1 | `subproject 'app' not found` → 1 |

Advice per row comes from `ConflictAdvice`'s three branches; its `app-build` rename was executed
and runs.

Three findings the problem statement lacked:

**The hook exemption.** A hookable built-in declaring `before`/`replace`/`after` is not a
conflict — `dva build` provably dispatches to the hook, not the default build. Keying the mark off
`IsReservedCommand` alone, as the original fix shape proposed, would have stamped
`shadowed_by_builtin` on correct hook declarations whose `usage_example: "dva build"` is right.
The predicate asks "does the bare form reach this?", which also excludes `app:build` for free.

**A namespaced key is reachable by nothing.** Found while writing the new warning, which offered
`dva run app:build` — exit 1. The old wording was accidentally *correct* here and the accurate
rewrite wrong. `ConflictAdvice` branches on it and does not print the failing form in full: a
machine consumer scanning for a `dva run …` form would lift it out of the negation.

**Subcommands are shadowed independently of their parent.** Tree keys are space-separated
(`build fast`), so the whole-key check missed them and the first fix still printed
`usage_example: "dva build fast"` — that runs the built-in with an argument. A hook-form parent
does *not* rescue its children either: measured, `dva build fast` dispatches to the parent's
`replace:` hook and ignores `fast`.

### Surfaces

- `manifest.go` — `usage_example` and `shadowed_by_builtin` both come from the shared
  `interactionUsage`. The field is set **only** when shadowed, so its presence is the signal, and
  its value names a real `static_commands` key (asserted in the same document).
- `list.go` — the one source for both surfaces. The text row is marked in all three shapes
  `printTable` produces (detailed, plain-with-description, plain).
- `reserved.go` — `FormatConflictWarnings` emits one sorted clause per conflict. It detailed
  `conflicts[0]` only, a map-iteration artifact: the same config named a different command run to
  run, and the kinds do not share advice.
- `USAGE.md` — the "**충돌** — 무시됨" rows became the validate outcome plus a "도달하는 호출"
  column. `충돌은 에러가 아니라 경고` was false in both halves and is gone; the doc now states
  that `validate`/`config validate` exit 1 while `ls`/`manifest`/`run` exit 0 on that config.
  Its hook example also used `- run:` with no `step:`, which `validate` rejects though the runner
  executes it — the repo's only two such lines, now `step:`/`run:` pairs like `examples/`
  ([TASK-083](083-a-step-without-run-announces-work-it-never-does.md)).

## Evidence

Mutation checks — a not-contains assertion passes trivially if the path is never reached:

| mutation | tests that must fail | result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interactionUsage` returns `dva <k>` unconditionally | the 4 mark tests (6 subtests) | FAIL; the 3 leave-alone tests passed |
| drop the hook exemption from `ShadowedByBuiltin` | both hook tests | FAIL; also 2 pre-existing config tests |
| namespaced branch offers `dva run <key>` again | both advice tests | FAIL |
| non-hookable branch reverts to the old wording | both advice tests | FAIL |
| `FormatConflictWarnings` details `conflicts[0]` only | the stability test | FAIL |
| drop the nesting branch from `interactionUsage` | both subcommand subtests | FAIL, mark tests unaffected |

Each restore verified with `diff -q` reporting identical. Every invocation named in a new message
or doc sentence was executed: `dva run build|status|build fast`, `dva status`, `dva build` on four
hook fixtures (`step:`-only, `run:`-only, `step:`+`run:`, bare), `dva app-build`, `validate`,
`config validate`, `ls`, `manifest`.

## Non-goals

- Which command wins is unchanged; built-in shadowing is designed behaviour.
- The conflicting entry stays in `ls`/`manifest`. A user who declared it needs to see dva received
  it; silence would be worse than a wrong label.
- No `--json` error envelope — [TASK-079](079-json-flag-does-not-cover-failures.md).

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] A reserved-name interaction carries a machine-readable mark in the manifest | verify: `go test ./internal/cli/ -run TestManifestMarksReservedInteraction`

- [x] Full suite passes | verify: `make test`
- [x] Binary builds | verify: `make build`

## Left open

- **`app:build` is still advertised unmarked.** `manifest` prints `usage_example: "dva app:build"`
  for a key no invocation reaches — this task's defect, in the branch the non-goals excluded.
  `ShadowedByBuiltin` is correctly false: nothing shadows it, it is unroutable, so the surfaces
  need a third state rather than a reuse of this one.
- **`validate` is fatal while the load path proceeds.** `ls`/`manifest`/`run` exit 0 on a config
  `validate` rejects — invalid and running at once. Accidental rather than chosen; USAGE.md
  documents it as-is.
- **`USAGE.md` is 729 lines / 27.6KB** vs the 500-line / 10KB standard — over before this change
  too (714 / 26.3KB). Splitting it is its own task.

## Related — the loop that should have caught this

`ref-evaluation.md`'s `lifecycle_boundary` surface only discovers services owned by two of stack,
plans, applications, interaction — never `interaction:` against the **built-in command namespace**,
so dva's answer here was never scored. Same gap as
[TASK-082](../decision/082-the-dogfood-loop-cannot-score-an-absent-section.md); adding the reserved
set as an owner changes `case_manifest_hash`, so stage 60 must treat the next run as a cross-run
promotion.
