  Verified by orchestrator: all six subcommands present in USAGE.md; default_mode
  documented (5 mentions); documented commands confirmed to exist in the binary.
  Scope grew slightly for coherence: USAGE.md documented ZERO app subcommands and
  barely mentioned stack, so full tables were added rather than extending a list;
  `modes` was also undocumented and default_mode is meaningless without it, so a row
  was added. README.md deliberately untouched (edit-restricted); documenting in
  USAGE.md satisfies the criterion, which accepts either file.

# Task 016: Document Undocumented Surface

## Summary

Six shipped subcommands and the `default_mode` config key exist but appear in no
user-facing doc. Docs are incomplete here, not wrong — no correctness risk, so this is
LOW.

## Evidence

CLI set comparison (binary = ground truth): 51 total / 43 documented / **8 binary-only** /
1 doc-only.

Undocumented but shipped (each verified present via its own `Short` in the parent group's
`Available Commands:`):

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `dva app build` | Build applications (use `--docker` for container build) |
| `dva app log` | Show recent logs for an application (last 100 lines) |
| `dva app restart` | Restart applications (stop then start) |
| `dva app stop` | Stop applications without removing state |
| `dva stack log` | View logs for a stack entry |
| `dva stack stop` | Stop stack entries without removing resources |

`README.md:71-74` documents only `app ls/up/down`; `README.md:66-68` only
`stack up/down/status`. A reader cannot discover the per-app/per-stack verbs.

`default_mode`: implemented at `internal/config/config.go:27`, validated at
`internal/config/validate.go:103-113`, warned at `internal/config/validate_warnings.go:273-278`.
Grep across `docs/`, `USAGE.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `examples/` → **zero hits**.
It is a valid schema key users cannot discover. No documented default exists, so there is
nothing to contradict — a pure omission.

## Out Of Scope

- `dva completion` and `dva help` — cobra built-ins, conventionally undocumented. No action.
- `dva config improve` (`USAGE.md:55`) — does not exist, but the line explicitly labels it
  historical ("과거 `dva config improve --docs-only`와 동일") while documenting the current
  `dva config docs`. **Review-only**: optionally reword to drop the dead command name;
  leaving as-is is acceptable.
- CLI **flags** remain unaudited (`coverage denominator unknown`) — a separate audit.

## Completion Criteria

- [x] All six subcommands appear in `README.md` or `USAGE.md` | verify: `for c in "app build" "app log" "app restart" "app stop" "stack log" "stack stop"; do /usr/bin/grep -rqF "dva $c" README.md USAGE.md || { echo "MISSING: dva $c"; exit 1; }; done; echo OK`
- [x] `default_mode` is documented as a config key | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -rn "default_mode" USAGE.md docs/ README.md`
- [x] No documented command is absent from the binary (no new doc-only drift) | verify: `./bin/dva app build --help && ./bin/dva stack log --help`

## Dependencies

None. Doc-only.
