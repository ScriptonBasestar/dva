  Option C's deliverable is real and present: `Makefile:127` carries no `(CI)` suffix, and the
  Makefile's sole `(CI)` label (`Makefile:86`, fmt-check) is backed by `ci.yml:49`. I read ci.yml
  directly rather than trusting the task's table — the task's CI inventory (lines 30-34) is now
  stale: CI also runs `make doc-check` (ci.yml:23), an `Install gopls` step, and an inline
  `gopls check` step, none of which the task lists. `check-generate` is still absent from CI, as
  the record says.
  Side claims re-measured and confirmed: `.agents/skills` and `claude-plugin/skills` are both mode
  120000 with the same blob (42c5394), so they can only go red on retarget; `git check-ignore -v`
  reports `.cursor/rules` ignored by `.gitignore:30` and `.opencode/skills` by the user's global
  ignore. The residual risk (CI never checks generated freshness) is untracked in
  tasks/todo|blocked|decision|plan — but the record explicitly accepts it rather than deferring it,
  so that is a decision, not missing follow-up.

# Task 112: a gate that says `(CI)` and is not in CI

## Problem

`Makefile:88` defines the target and names its purpose in the help line:

```make
## check-generate: Verify generated files are up-to-date (CI)
check-generate: generate
	@git diff --exit-code $(GEN_LIBRARY) $(WF_LIBRARY)/shared-guardrails.md AGENTS.md .agents/skills claude-plugin/skills \
		|| { echo "ERROR: generated files are stale — run 'make generate' and commit"; exit 1; }
```

`grep -n 'check-generate' .github/workflows/ci.yml` returns **nothing**. Every step in the file,
measured:

| job | steps |
| --- | --- |
| `test` | `make build`, `make test`, `make test-integration`, `go vet ./...` |
| `lint` | `make fmt-check`, `golangci-lint-action@v8` |
| `goreleaser-check` | `goreleaser check` |

So nothing verifies that committed generated files match their sources. The `(CI)` suffix asserts
a guarantee the repo does not have.

## Why it matters

This is latent, not broken. Measured today: `make check-generate` exits **0** and leaves no diff,
so the generated files are currently in sync. The defect is that *nobody would find out* if they
stopped being — which is the same shape as
[TASK-078](../archive/078-nine-files-do-not-satisfy-gofmt-and-nothing-checks.md) (nine files drifted
because no gate looked) and
[TASK-109](109-the-task-link-check-has-been-red-for-22-links-since-the-repo-moved.md) (a
check that had been red for 22 links without anyone seeing it).

The blast radius is real because the generated set spans four projections of one source:

| guarded path | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `internal/cli/library_reference.txt` | embeddable library reference, corpus for `removed_keys_test.go` |
| `agent-mesh-flows/shared/library/shared-guardrails.md` | has `tools/libgen`-injected Go facts (reserved commands, section order) |
| `AGENTS.md` | Codex projection — a marked section rewritten by `skillgen` |
| `.agents/skills`, `claude-plugin/skills` | symlinks into `skills/` |

A stale `shared-guardrails.md` means the AUTOGEN fact blocks disagree with the Go source they were
extracted from — the exact single-source guarantee that
[TASK-061](../archive/061-go-facts-hand-copied-into-flow-library.md) built `tools/libgen` to provide.
That task replaced hand-copied Go facts with generated ones; an unrun freshness check is how they
quietly become hand-copied again.

## A second, smaller finding in the same file

CI restates commands the Makefile already owns:

- `- name: Vet` / `run: go vet ./...`, while `Makefile:54` defines `vet: go vet ./...`
- the `lint` job uses `golangci-lint-action@v8` with a pinned version, while `Makefile:44`
  defines `lint` to run the mise-pinned binary

Two owners for one command means they can drift — CI can pass a check the developer's `make lint`
does not run, and vice versa. The `Format` step added under TASK-078 deliberately went the other
way (`run: make fmt-check`, with the gofmt invocation living only in the Makefile).

## Options

- **A — add `make check-generate` to the `test` job.** One step, uses the Go toolchain already set
  up. Turns a latent gap into an enforced invariant. Cost: any PR that edits `skills/` or the
  library sources without running `make generate` now goes red — correct, but it is a new failure
  mode for contributors who did not know the target existed.
- **B — add it, and also collapse the duplicated commands** (`Vet` → `make vet`), so the Makefile
  is the single owner of what each gate runs. Larger diff, addresses both findings.
- **C — drop the `(CI)` label.** Zero enforcement, but the Makefile stops claiming a guarantee that
  does not exist. Cheapest honest option.

## Unverified

**Whether `check-generate` can actually fail has not been demonstrated.** It passes today, but a
gate proven only in its green state is exactly what TASK-078 and TASK-109 warn about. Verifying it
requires perturbing a source file and confirming the target goes red — deliberately not done here,
because `make generate` rewrites `shared-guardrails.md` in place (libgen injects into it), so the
probe must be reverted with care rather than casually.

## Resolution

**Option C — drop the `(CI)` label.** One line, `Makefile:102`:

```diff
-## check-generate: Verify generated files are up-to-date (CI)
+## check-generate: Verify generated files are up-to-date
```

### What C buys

The Makefile now carries exactly one `(CI)` label, and it is true:

| target | `(CI)` label | invoked by `ci.yml` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fmt-check` | yes | yes — `ci.yml:46`, `run: make fmt-check` |
| `check-generate` | no (was yes) | no |

That is the entire point. The suffix was not a description, it was a claim, and the claim was
false. The vocabulary now reads correctly in both directions: a labelled target is in CI, an
unlabelled one is not. C adds no enforcement and no longer pretends to.

⚠️ Only the first direction holds. Measured 2026-08-03: `ci.yml` invokes five make targets —
`doc-check` (`:23`), `build` (`:26`), `test` (`:29`), `test-integration` (`:32`), `fmt-check`
(`:49`) — and `grep -c '(CI)' Makefile` is **1**. Four of the five are in CI and unlabelled, so
absence of the suffix says nothing. `(CI)` is sufficient, not necessary. The Problem table three
lines above already lists `build`/`test`/`test-integration` as CI steps, which contradicts the
sentence in the same file. Tracked as
[TASK-154](../todo/154-the-ci-suffix-marks-one-of-the-five-targets-ci-actually-runs.md).

### What C deliberately does not do

Two of the five original criteria were written for options A and B. They are left unchecked rather
than reworded, because C's premise is to stop asserting a guarantee — not to build one:

- CI still never runs the gate, so generated files can still go stale unnoticed;
- the gate still prints nothing on success, so a vacuous run is indistinguishable from a real one.

The residual risk is exactly as stated in Problem above, and is now accepted rather than closed: if
`skills/` or `agent-mesh-flows/shared/library/` is edited without `make generate`, the committed
projections drift and only a developer who happens to run the target locally finds out.

### Measured while resolving — the gate is narrower than its path list suggests

`git diff --exit-code` is handed five paths. Two are tracked as symlinks:

```
120000 42c5394a18a882778ebf50eb940fb5a96bc4a6d9 0	.agents/skills
120000 42c5394a18a882778ebf50eb940fb5a96bc4a6d9 0	claude-plugin/skills
```

git compares a symlink by its target string, so those two entries can only go red if `skillgen`
*retargets* them — never if the content behind `../skills` changes. The paths actually carrying the
check are `internal/cli/library_reference.txt`, `agent-mesh-flows/shared/library/shared-guardrails.md`
and `AGENTS.md`. So the five-path list overstates the coverage by two.

The two remaining projections `skillgen` writes are correctly outside a git-diff check, and this was
verified rather than assumed: `git check-ignore` reports both `.cursor/rules` and `.opencode/skills`
ignored and untracked, so a diff-based gate could not observe them at all. An initial reading that
called `.cursor/rules` an uncovered gap was wrong — `.gitignore:30` excludes it on purpose.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] The label matches reality | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -c '(CI)' Makefile` — 1, on `fmt-check`, which `ci.yml:46` runs
- [x] Nothing regenerates dirty | verify: `make check-generate && git status --porcelain` — measured: exit 0, empty
- [x] Full suite passes | verify: `make test` — cli 63.6%, config 66.6%, exec 63.3%, lifecycle 56.1%, runner 53.6%, all ok
- [ ] The gate is proven able to fail | verify: `human — A/B criterion, not met by C: no CI gate was added, so there is no enforced failure mode to prove`
- [ ] The gate is non-vacuous | verify: `make check-generate` — **A/B criterion, not met by C**: the target still exits silently and still names none of the paths it compared

## Related

- [TASK-078](../archive/078-nine-files-do-not-satisfy-gofmt-and-nothing-checks.md) — found this while
  adding the format gate; same class, and its `Format` step is the pattern to copy.
- [TASK-111](111-make-lint-reports-zero-issues-while-an-available-analyzer-has-50.md) — the third
  instance: a green gate whose coverage nobody had stated.

## Correction (TASK-154)

The closing claim that "a labelled target is in CI, an unlabelled one is not" was **one-way only**
at archive time: only `fmt-check` had `(CI)` while CI also ran `doc-check`, `build`, `test`, and
`test-integration`. [TASK-154](../done/154-the-ci-suffix-marks-one-of-the-five-targets-ci-actually-runs.md)
labels all five and gates the sets with `go run ./tools/cilabels` from `make doc-check`.
