  Verified by orchestrator: both USAGE.md and docs/30 now state the chain describes the plan
  path, define `environment vars` as environments.<name>.environment, and give the root
  environment: < env_file < OS order for the dva run path. No contradiction with CLAUDE.md.
  COMMIT HYGIENE NOTE: this task's USAGE.md hunk was swept into TASK-021's commit a204856 by
  an orchestrator staging error - the edit was already in the working tree when USAGE.md was
  staged for TASK-021. Only docs/30 is in this task's own commit. The net file state is
  correct and both tasks are complete; only commit attribution is split. Not rewritten,
  since splitting one file's intermixed hunks needs interactive staging, which is
  unavailable here, and rewriting risked the verified work.

# Task 022: vars Chain Omits The Root environment: Map

## Summary

The corrected vars precedence chain (TASK-012) never places the **root** `environment:`
map, and its "environment vars" term invites the reader to assume it means exactly that —
which would give them the wrong order relative to `env_file`.

## Evidence

The chain now published at `USAGE.md`, `docs/30-config-merge-semantics.md` and
`internal/config/schema.json`:

```
env_file < global vars < environment vars < site vars < plan vars < CLI vars < OS
```

Here "environment vars" means `environments.<name>.environment` (the plan path). The
**root** `environment:` block is a different thing on a different path, and its order is
the inverse of what the chain implies:

- Root `environment:` is applied by `loadEnv` (`internal/cli/root.go:249-252`) **before**
  `env_file` overwrites it → `environment:` < `env_file`, as TASK-018 corrected in
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- The chain lists `env_file` **lowest**, so a reader mapping "environment vars" onto the
  root `environment:` block would conclude `env_file < environment:` — exactly backwards.

Both statements are individually correct for their own path; the hazard is the collision of
terms. This is a docs-clarity gap, not a behavioral defect — no code change is implied.

## Out Of Scope

- Any Go behavior change. Both paths behave correctly.
- Renaming config keys.

## Completion Criteria

- [x] The chain states which path it describes, and that "environment vars" means `environments.<name>.environment`, not the root `environment:` block | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -n "environments.<name>.environment\|environments\.<name>" USAGE.md docs/30-config-merge-semantics.md`
- [x] The root `environment:` vs `env_file` order is stated or cross-referenced where the chain appears | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -rn "env_file" USAGE.md docs/30-config-merge-semantics.md | head`
- [x] No claim contradicts CLAUDE.md's `environment:` < `env_file` < OS | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -n "environment:` < `env_file" CLAUDE.md`
