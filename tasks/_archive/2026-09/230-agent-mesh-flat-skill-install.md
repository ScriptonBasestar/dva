# Task 230: Agent Mesh flat skill installation

## Decision

Add `agent-mesh` to the existing `dva skill install`, `status`, and `uninstall` runtime surface;
do not add a separate export command. The runtime owns only its DVA namespace:
`~/.config/agent-mesh/skills/dva/` for user scope and `.agent-mesh/skills/dva/` for project scope.

The adapter produces `dva.md` and `dva-config.md` from the embedded canonical skills. It removes
YAML frontmatter, keeps the canonical body, and appends `references/*` and text `assets/*` in
deterministic path order. Relative bundle resolution is not assumed, so local paths link to their
inlined content. DVA owns file installation and receipt verification only; `am skill sync` and
its interactions with other targets are outside this contract.

## Completion Criteria

- [x] `agent-mesh` resolves to the documented user and project namespace paths | verify: `go test ./internal/skillinstall -run TestRuntimePaths`
- [x] Install renders deterministic flat `dva.md` and `dva-config.md` without YAML frontmatter | verify: `go test ./internal/skillinstall -run TestAgentMeshInstallsFlatRenderedSkills`
- [x] Collision, format-bound receipt, drift, dry-run, uninstall, and mixed-runtime preflight retain the existing safety contract | verify: `go test ./internal/skillinstall`
- [x] Agent Mesh documentation states the renderer degradation policy and keeps `am skill sync` outside DVA ownership | verify: `make doc-check`
- [x] Focused and repository mechanical checks pass | verify: `make test-skill-dogfood && make doc-check && make commit-check`
