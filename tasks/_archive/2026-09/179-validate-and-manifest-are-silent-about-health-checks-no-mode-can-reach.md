# Task 179: Say that a top-level health check with no mode to reach it will never run

## Problem

Top-level `health_checks.<name>.start` executes through exactly one path, and that path is
gated three times on a section the config need not declare:

```go
// internal/lifecycle/orchestrator.go:428
func (o *Orchestrator) startModeProcesses(...) error {
	if opts.Mode == "" { return nil }                        // gate 1
	mode, ok := o.cfg.Modes[opts.Mode]
	if !ok || len(mode.HealthChecks) == 0 { return nil }     // gates 2, 3
	...
	hc, ok := o.cfg.HealthChecks[hcName]                     // :445 — never reached
```

`signalModeProcesses` (`:548`) gates identically for the down/stop half. Every other reader of
`c.HealthChecks` is display (`cli/show.go:299,477`, `cli/manifest.go:396`) or merge
(`config/merge.go:50,452`). The one validation-side reader,
`warnHealthCheckRedundancy` (`validate_warnings.go:323`), checks `start` against `start_hint`
for redundancy and never asks whether anything can reach the entry.

The nested `stack.<entry>.health_checks` is a **different field** (`config/lifecycle.go:40`),
read un-gated at `orchestrator.go:148,328`. A config can therefore have a live check and a dead
twin under the same service name, and nothing distinguishes them.

Measured against `flow-pipechain-devbox` on the installed `0.1.44` / `488fc19`
(`sha256 ce8c3be9…`), a config with four `health_checks.*.start` entries and no `modes:`:

| | result |
|---|---|
| `dva config validate` | exit 0, `✅ dva.yml is valid` + 4 unrelated Makefile suggestions. **0** lines naming health / start / any of the four services |
| non-vacuity control | the same pattern matches **5×** in `dva.yml` itself, so that 0 is a real zero |
| `dva config show -f yaml` | line 1151: `modes: {}`, `default_mode: ""` |
| `dva manifest -f json` | publishes all four `health_checks` **including their `start` keys**, and has no `modes` key at all |

The machine-readable surface is the worse half: it advertises four runnable commands while
omitting the only section that can run them. A consumer reading the manifest has no way to tell
these four from four that work.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `dva config validate` names every `health_checks.<name>` that declares `start` (or
      `start_hint`) when no `modes.*.health_checks` entry references it, and says why it will not
      run. A warning, not an error — the config is not malformed.
      Verify: `go test ./internal/config/ -run HealthCheck -count=1`
- [x] Negative control: a config that **does** declare `modes:` referencing those checks
      validates clean, with no new warning. Without this the fix trades a false negative for a
      false positive.
      Verify: `go test ./internal/config/ -run HealthCheck -count=1`
- [x] A config with `modes:` declared but a mode referencing a `health_checks` name that does not
      exist is covered by the same pass, or the decision to leave it alone is recorded with its
      reason.
      Verify: `human — the decision and its reasoning are in the Result section`
- [x] `dva manifest -f json` either marks unreachable health checks or stops publishing their
      `start`. Decide which and say why: a consumer that scripts against the manifest currently
      cannot tell a live `start` from a dead one.
- [x] The nested `stack.*.health_checks` form draws **no** warning from this pass. It is a
      different field on a different code path and is reached un-gated.
- [x] Corpus: report how many configs under `examples/` declare a top-level `health_checks` with
      `start` and no `modes:`, including zero, measured from `dva config validate` output rather
      than grep.
- [x] `make test` exits 0.

## Unit progress

### 179-warn-unreachable-hc (done)

- Added `warnUnreachableHealthChecks` in `internal/config/validate_warnings.go`, wired into
  `ValidateWarnings`.
- Warns top-level `health_checks.<name>` with `start` and/or `start_hint` when no
  `modes.*.health_checks` names it.
- Same pass: dangling `modes.*.health_checks` → missing top-level name (runtime skips silently).
- Nested `stack.*.health_checks` intentionally not scanned.
- Tests: `TestWarnUnreachableHealthChecks` (subtests for positive, negative, partial, nested
  silence, dangling mode ref, order stability).

### 179-manifest-mark (done)

- Decision: **mark**, do not strip `start`. Same shape as TASK-137's `unroutable` mark —
  presence of the field is the signal. Omitting `start` would hide what was configured and
  leave `start_hint` alone as a half-fix; the mark lets a consumer contrast declared vs
  runnable while keeping diagnosis intact.
- `ManifestHealthCheck` gains `start_unreachable` (bool, omitempty) and
  `start_unreachable_reason` (same sentence shape as `warnUnreachableHealthChecks`).
- Readiness-only entries (no `start`/`start_hint`) stay unmarked. Mode-referenced entries
  stay unmarked. Partial mode coverage marks only the unreferenced ones.
- Tests: `TestBuildManifest_MarksUnreachableHealthCheckStart`,
  `TestBuildManifest_ReachableHealthCheckStartUnmarked`.

### 179-suite (done)

- Corpus: `DVA_FILE=<examples/*.yml|examples/modules/main.yml> ./bin/dva config validate` over
  17 example configs. **0** configs emit
  `health_checks.<name>: declares … but no modes.*.health_checks entry references it`.
  None of the examples declare top-level `health_checks` with `start`/`start_hint` (and none
  declare `modes:` that would reference them). Full log: `tmp/179-corpus-validate.txt`.
- `make test` (Go 1.26.4 via mise GOROOT/PATH) exits 0. Log: `tmp/179-make-test.txt`.

### Residual

- none

## Result

**Dangling mode → missing health_checks name:** covered by the same pass. Reason: `startModeProcesses`
/`signalModeProcesses` do `hc, ok := o.cfg.HealthChecks[hcName]; if !ok || hc.Start == "" { continue }`,
so a typo validates clean and does nothing. A second warning is cheaper than another silent path.

**Manifest surface:** marks unreachable start rather than stripping it. A consumer that only
looks for a non-empty `start` still has a residual footgun — they must also check
`start_unreachable` — but the machine-readable surface now carries a detectable state that
validate already names for humans.

**Corpus (`examples/`):** 0 of 17 configs produce the new unreachable-health-check warning under
`dva config validate`. The defect class is real (dogfood baseline) but not present in the
in-repo examples corpus.

## Notes

Found as the owner finding of dogfood run `20260805-143543-f82daf`, where it is being carried
through the improve → forward-test → evaluate stages. Filing it here so the defect outlives the
run directory, which is `tmp/` and git-ignored.

The competing reading — "the target project should just delete the block" — was considered and
rejected: deleting it from one `dva.yml` leaves every other project with the same silent config.
The target-side half (those four dead commands have drifted from their live twins and omit `.env`
sourcing) survives this fix and is the target repository's to fix, not this one's.

Same shape as [TASK-137](../done/137-manifest-advertises-the-unroutable-namespaced-form-with-no-mark.md)
— the manifest advertising a form nothing can route — one section over.
