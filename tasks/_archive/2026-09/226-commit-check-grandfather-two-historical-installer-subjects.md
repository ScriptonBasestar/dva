# Task 226: grandfather the two historical installer subjects

## Summary

`make commit-check` correctly reads every non-merge commit after baseline
`c100ba06`, but it reports two historical scope-less installer commits:
`d7976538` and `c6ed4eab`. Rewriting published history is disproportionate, and
moving the baseline would stop checking every other commit in the intervening
range.

## Decision

Keep the baseline unchanged. Add only two exact exceptions, each pinned by the
full immutable SHA and its exact subject. The gate must continue to check every
other post-baseline commit. The subject pin is intentionally redundant with a
Git object ID: it makes the exceptional policy auditable and makes a changed
exception table fail its tests.

## Completion Criteria

- [x] Only `d7976538a9f68dad0c7873ce8c256fb7c60212a0` / `feat: add deterministic skill installer` and `c6ed4eab2750ec4e6aca3e130dfcad61abc3fc6f` / `fix: harden skill installation transactions` are waived | verify: `go test ./tools/commitcheck`
- [x] A SHA or subject drift, and a future commit with either subject, remain violations | verify: `go test ./tools/commitcheck`
- [x] The original baseline remains `c100ba06de0e64ebe6079908b8681b993e674a58` | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -Fq 'const baseline = "c100ba06de0e64ebe6079908b8681b993e674a58"' tools/commitcheck/main.go`
- [x] `make commit-check` is green against the full available history | verify: `make commit-check`
