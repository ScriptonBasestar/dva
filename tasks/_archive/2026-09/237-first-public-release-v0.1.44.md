# Task 237: publish the first public v0.1.44 release

## Supersession

TASK-238 supersedes this publication target with `v0.1.45`. The local lightweight `v0.1.44`
tag remains immutable historical evidence at `49d444cc8f4fb128c61b00f6789b577545bc7a21`, and no
remote `v0.1.44` tag, draft, or release exists. Validator fixes and effective-default-plan
observability were integrated after that tag, so publishing the older candidate would exclude the
configuration behavior exercised by the completed DVA waves. This record retains the failed
authorization attempt and recovery evidence; it is no longer an active publication procedure.

GitHub read authorization was restored and the fail-closed preflight found no local or remote
`v0.1.44` tag and an empty release list before this task entered `doing`. The later publish attempt
proved that the replacement token still lacks release-write authority.

## Decision

Proceed with option A from TASK-063: publish `v0.1.44`. The user explicitly approved this
direction after the retained GoReleaser configuration passed the six-platform snapshot gate and
the installed binary passed live skill discovery in Codex, Claude Code, Agent Mesh, OpenCode, and
Grok. TASK-063 remains immutable history of the earlier option-B decision; this task records the
later product decision that supersedes it.

Tag creation, draft creation, asset uploads, and publication are separate external operations; no
procedure can make them atomic. Minimize and make that partial state recoverable rather than
claiming it cannot happen. The README remains source-install-only until public assets exist.

## Authorization history and current preflight

The original fine-grained token exceeded the organization's 366-day lifetime limit. It was
replaced without recording credential details here, and `gh repo view` now reports `ADMIN`.
Neither that account-level view nor a Git push through a separate credential path proves that
`GITHUB_TOKEN` has release-write scope. A human must confirm **Contents: read/write** on the token,
and the read-only probes below must still succeed immediately before another public release
attempt:

```sh
set -eu
gh repo view ScriptonBasestar/dva
remote_tag="$(git ls-remote --tags origin refs/tags/v0.1.44)"
test -z "$remote_tag"
release_json="$(gh release list --repo ScriptonBasestar/dva --limit 100 --json tagName)"
printf '%s\n' "$release_json" | jq -e 'all(.[]; .tagName != "v0.1.44")'
```

## Publication procedure

Prepare the final release commit first. Change `.goreleaser.yml` from its snapshot-only policy to
an explicit publication policy with `release.target_commitish: "{{ .Commit }}"`,
`use_existing_draft: true`, and `replace_existing_artifacts: true`. Keep `draft: false`: GoReleaser
still creates a GitHub draft while uploading and publishes it only after the uploads complete.
These settings let the pinned GoReleaser 2.12.7 create the remote tag at the exact release commit
and resume an interrupted draft without deleting or moving the tag.

After committing and verifying that tree, integrate the release-preparation commits into
`master`, push `origin/master`, and start publication from a clean worktree at that exact source
tip. Only then record `release_commit="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"` before creating the tag. Treat that
value as the publication identity; later documentation commits may move `HEAD`. Every local and
remote tag comparison must resolve `v0.1.44` back to that recorded commit rather than comparing it
with whichever commit happens to be checked out later.

Create a **local lightweight** `v0.1.44` tag at the clean release commit; do not push it separately.
An annotated local tag would not match the commit ref GitHub creates from `target_commitish`.
Before any external write, exercise real release mode locally—not snapshot mode—and validate its
outputs:

```sh
git tag v0.1.44 "$release_commit"
goreleaser release --skip=publish --clean
go run ./tools/releasecheck artifacts --dist dist
```

If this local-only validation requires a source correction, first prove that both remote probes
still report no tag or release, delete only the unpublished local tag, make and verify the final
commit, and create the local tag again. Once any remote state exists, the tag is immutable for
this procedure and recovery stays on that exact commit and tag.

After repeating the unblock probes, require both
`test "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$release_commit"` and
`test "$(git rev-list -n1 v0.1.44)" = "$release_commit"`, then run pinned
`mise exec -- goreleaser release --clean`. Keep the original recorded value in the release shell or
restore that exact value from the release evidence; do not recompute it from the tag for this
pre-publish guard. Publication is still not atomic: interruption can leave a draft and its tag. On
failure, inspect the remote tag and draft, fix authorization or connectivity, and rerun for the
**same** local tag. Never delete, repoint, or recreate a public release tag to conceal a failed
attempt. The existing-draft and artifact-replacement settings make that retry the declared
recovery path.
Escalate instead of inventing a different tag if the remote tag points anywhere other than the
intended release commit.

## Completion criteria

- [ ] Record the explicit publication and retry policy in `.goreleaser.yml` without implying that CI publishes | verify: `goreleaser check && test "$(/usr/bin/grep -Fxc '  target_commitish: "{{ .Commit }}"' .goreleaser.yml)" -eq 1 && test "$(/usr/bin/grep -Fxc '  use_existing_draft: true' .goreleaser.yml)" -eq 1 && test "$(/usr/bin/grep -Fxc '  replace_existing_artifacts: true' .goreleaser.yml)" -eq 1 && test "$(/usr/bin/grep -Fxc '  draft: false' .goreleaser.yml)" -eq 1`
- [ ] Re-run all repository and six-platform release gates at the exact release commit | verify: `dva lint && dva test && dva test integration && make test-skill-dogfood && make doc-check && make commit-check && mise exec -- make release-check`
- [ ] Validate a local lightweight tag against `internal/config.Version` and build real release-mode artifacts without publishing | verify: `test "$(git cat-file -t v0.1.44)" = commit && go run ./tools/releasecheck version --tag "$(git describe --tags --exact-match)" && goreleaser release --skip=publish --clean && go run ./tools/releasecheck artifacts --dist dist`
- [ ] Publish through GoReleaser, then prove the remote tag resolves to the tagged release commit and the release has exactly six archives plus `checksums.txt` | verify: `release_commit="$(git rev-list -n1 v0.1.44)" && test -n "$release_commit" && remote_tag="$(git ls-remote origin refs/tags/v0.1.44 | cut -f1)" && test "$remote_tag" = "$release_commit" && gh release view v0.1.44 --repo ScriptonBasestar/dva --json isDraft,tagName,assets | jq -e '(.isDraft == false) and (.tagName == "v0.1.44") and (([.assets[].name] | sort) == (["checksums.txt","dva_darwin_amd64.tar.gz","dva_darwin_arm64.tar.gz","dva_linux_amd64.tar.gz","dva_linux_arm64.tar.gz","dva_windows_amd64.zip","dva_windows_arm64.zip"] | sort))'`
- [ ] Verify immediate tagged-module installation directly from GitHub and execute the installed binary | verify: `tmp_bin="$(mktemp -d)"; trap 'rm -rf "$tmp_bin"' EXIT; GOPROXY=direct GOBIN="$tmp_bin" go install github.com/ScriptonBasestar/dva/cmd/dva@v0.1.44 && "$tmp_bin/dva" version | /usr/bin/grep -q '^dva version 0.1.44$'`
- [ ] Add pinned-version, checksum-verifying binary installation documentation only after the assets exist | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -Fq 'github.com/ScriptonBasestar/dva/cmd/dva@v0.1.44' README.md && /usr/bin/grep -Fq '/releases/download/v0.1.44/checksums.txt' README.md && /usr/bin/grep -Eq 'sha256sum|shasum -a 256' README.md && make doc-check`
- [ ] Record release URL, artifact names/checksums, checks, push state, and final external probes; then remove the local `dist/` build output before archiving this card | verify: `test ! -e dist`

## Publication attempt

The release-preparation commit `49d444cc8f4fb128c61b00f6789b577545bc7a21` was integrated
into `master` and passed lint, race/coverage tests, integration tests, six-runtime installer
dogfood, documentation and commit gates, and the six-platform snapshot gate. A local lightweight
`v0.1.44` tag and `goreleaser release --skip=publish --clean` then produced the exact six archives,
valid `checksums.txt`, and a host binary stamped with that commit and version.

The public `goreleaser release --clean` attempt rebuilt the artifacts but GitHub rejected release
creation with `403 Resource not accessible by personal access token`. Post-failure probes found no
remote tag, draft, or published release, so no partial external state needs repair. Keep the local
tag at the recorded release commit and retry the same publication command only after the token has
fine-grained **Contents: read/write** permission and the refreshed environment passes preflight.
Because this blocker record advances `master` beyond the release commit, retry from a new clean
**detached worktree at `v0.1.44`**, not from the current master checkout. Restore
`release_commit=49d444cc8f4fb128c61b00f6789b577545bc7a21`, require
`HEAD == v0.1.44 == release_commit`, and only then invoke GoReleaser.

## Preserved evidence

- Live-runtime-tested baseline source: `61d101943cc5a480f65715461818f11cdeb28781`
- Installed binary SHA-256: `be7033f2cb8581147b63835cd217a81e97cfd469240ef4cc2ec69f6146277f2e`
- `make release-check`: passed with Darwin/Linux/Windows on amd64/arm64 and `checksums.txt`
- CE/DVA neutral-claim dogfood: passed from the integrated flow devbox target
- Antigravity user projection: receipt, 12-file manifest, neutral claim, and bundle digest passed
  independent review; native IDE discovery remains unverified because no Antigravity host is
  installed, so this is not evidence of a live runtime pass
- Initial GitHub API preflight: blocked before tag creation by the organization token-lifetime
  policy; replacement authentication later passed with `ADMIN`, an empty release list, and no
  local or remote `v0.1.44` tag

The first two hashes identify the earlier reviewed pre-release state; the publication-attempt
section records the now-fixed release commit. A `master` advance **before local tag creation**
invalidates a candidate and requires all gates again. A blocker or documentation commit made
**after the local tag is fixed** does not move the release identity: retry from a detached worktree
at the existing tag and never retag the newer master. `GOPROXY=direct` is intentional for the
immediate module probe; the public proxy is the normal user path but may lag the new tag and can be
checked later.
