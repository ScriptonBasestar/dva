# Task 207: `dva restart` exits 0 on an unknown service name, pinned by a test citing a deleted command

## Summary

TASK-198 closed `dva restart --no-wat` (unknown **flag** read as a service name,
exit 0, nothing restarted). The same user-visible signature — exit 0, nothing
done, no error — survives through the name half of the same path, and `restart`
is the only lifecycle verb still exposed to it.

Measured against the **post-198** binary, so this is not a regression 198
introduced and not something 198 fixes:

```
restart zzznosuchservice     rc=0   [warn] no lifecycle entries matched filters
up      zzznosuchservice     rc=1   unexpected argument 'zzznosuchservice'
down    zzznosuchservice     rc=1   'dva down' downs all declared entries. Name a plan instead
stop    zzznosuchservice     rc=1   'dva stop' stops all declared entries. Name a plan instead
```

Identical result in a plans-present fixture, and via a tag filter matching
nothing (`restart -T zzznosuchtag` → rc=0). `restart` is the only verb that
legitimately takes positional service names, which is exactly why it is the only
one that can misread a typo as one — the same structural reason it was the
outlier in TASK-198.

`rejectUnknownFlags` cannot catch this: it fires only on a leading dash
(`internal/cli/selectors.go:57`, `len(a) >= 2 && strings.HasPrefix(a, "-")`).
The guard TASK-198 added sits one line above the code that discards the
unmatched name.

## The four tokens this covers

An adversarial review of TASK-198 found three more ways into the same rc=0,
nothing-done outcome. They are not separate defects — they are the same
unmatchable-name path reached by different tokens, which is why they belong in
one ruling instead of three:

```
restart zzznosuchservice       rc=0   nothing ran      an ordinary typo
restart --                     rc=0   nothing ran      terminator, no names follow
restart -                      rc=0   nothing ran      too short for the dash guard (len < 2)
restart -- --no-wat s1         rc=0   s1 ran           after `--` a flag IS a name; typo discarded
```

The last row is the worst of the four and matches what TASK-198 calls the worse
half of its own defect: something *does* happen, and the argument the user typed
is silently dropped. The bare `-` case is shared with `up` and `down` and is
pre-existing in all three.

TASK-198 deliberately declined to settle any of these. Its guard leaves `--` in
the name list rather than removing it, precisely so that this card decides what
an unmatchable name means instead of inheriting an answer from slice arithmetic
— an earlier draft removed the token and turned `dva restart --` into a full
stack bounce, which is recorded in `TestRestartBareTerminatorChangesNothing`.

## Why this is a decision and not just a fix

The behaviour is **already pinned by a passing test**, whose stated
justification names a command that no longer exists:

```go
// TestRestart_UnknownNameTouchesNothing matches the 'dva stack up bogus-name'
// reference path: warn, change nothing, exit 0.
```

`dva stack` was removed with the `applications:` section in the intent-centric
plan refactor (`6710766`, and CLAUDE.md records the removal). The reference path
this test conforms to is gone, and the verb that replaced it — `up` — took the
opposite ruling: `up zzznosuchservice` is rc=1. So the current behaviour is not
a decision that survived the refactor; it is a decision whose premise the
refactor deleted, left unexamined because the test kept passing.

That is what makes this a card rather than a one-line change. Whichever way it
is ruled, the test comment must stop citing `dva stack up`.

## The ruling to make

Three defensible outcomes, in the order I would argue them:

1. **Reject, matching `up`.** An unknown name is a typo far more often than an
   intentional no-op, and `restart` is the last verb that disagrees with its
   siblings. Cost: `dva restart $SERVICE` in a script now fails where it used to
   warn — and note `dva restart -- "$@"` with an empty `"$@"` becomes an error
   under this reading, which is the idiom `--` exists for.
2. **Reject only when *no* name matched**, keeping a partial match (`restart s1
   zzztypo`) as a warn. Narrower, and it preserves batch invocations.
3. **Keep exit 0 deliberately**, and rewrite the test comment to say so on its
   own terms rather than by reference to a deleted command.

This card does not assume (1). It requires that one of them be chosen and that
the test's rationale be replaced either way.

Note the interaction with TASK-198's Open Question — "should the empty selection
itself be an error?" — which covers the tag-filter arm of the same exit-0 path.
Settle the name arm here; a tag filter that legitimately matches nothing is a
different case and is not in scope.

## Completion Criteria

- [x] The ruling is stated in the card's disposition, naming which of the three outcomes was chosen and why | verify: human — read the disposition
- [x] `TestRestart_UnknownNameTouchesNothing` no longer justifies itself by `dva stack up` | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -c 'dva stack up' internal/cli/restart_names_test.go` returns 0 (today: 1)
- [x] The ruling is pinned by a test named for it, so the behaviour stops being inherited from the flag guard | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -c 'func TestRestartUnknownNameRuling' internal/cli/restart_names_test.go` returns 1 (today: 0)
- [x] That test exercises a plans-present config too, since the stack path is reachable with plans configured | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -A30 'func TestRestartUnknownNameRuling' internal/cli/restart_names_test.go | /usr/bin/grep -c 'writeRestartPlanProbeConfig'` returns ≥ 1 (today: 0, the function does not exist)
- [x] All four tokens from "The four tokens this covers" are ruled on together, not just the typo | verify: human — the disposition states the outcome for `zzznosuchservice`, `--`, `-`, and a flag after `--`; a ruling that leaves any of the four unnamed is incomplete
- [x] `TestRestartBareTerminatorChangesNothing` is updated rather than left asserting a behaviour this card overturned | verify: human — read the test and confirm it asserts the chosen ruling for `--`; a presence grep would pass unchanged and prove nothing
- [x] The whole cli package passes | verify: `go test ./internal/cli/ -count=1`
- [x] Confirmed against the built binary | verify: human — rebuild and re-run the 4-verb `zzznosuchservice` table from Summary; state which rows changed
- [x] `make test` passes | verify: `make test`

## Ruling (2026-08-20)

**Outcome (1) — reject, matching `up` — with the terminator consumed rather than
left in the name list.** The pairing matters: it is what dissolves the objection
the card itself raises against (1).

One precision the Summary table invites a reader to miss, measured rather than
inferred: `up`/`down`/`stop` do not perform a name check at all. They read a
positional argument as a **plan** name only, so in a plan-less config `dva up s1`
is rc=1 even though `s1` IS a declared entry. What restart now shares with them is
the outcome for an unknown name, not the mechanism — it remains the only lifecycle
verb taking entry names positionally, which is both why it was the last one exposed
to this defect and why it is the only one that can tell a declared name from a typo.

Outcome (2), rejecting only when *no* name matched, was rejected on the card's own
worst row. `restart -- --no-wat s1` matches `s1`, so under (2) it stays rc=0 with
the typo discarded — the exact "does something while ignoring what you asked for"
shape TASK-198 calls the worse half of its own defect. A partial-match rule
preserves batch invocations by preserving the silent drop that makes them wrong.

Outcome (3), keeping exit 0 on its own terms, would leave `restart` the last
lifecycle verb disagreeing with its siblings, with no argument for the difference
beyond a deleted command's precedent.

The card's stated cost of (1) — that `dva restart -- "$@"` with an empty `"$@"`
becomes an error, breaking the idiom `--` exists for — is real under (1) alone, and
is why the terminator is now consumed inside `restartCmd`. With it consumed, the
empty case means "no names given", which is what a bare `dva restart` already
means. TASK-198 measured the opposite escalation (dropping the token turned
`restart --` into a whole-stack bounce at rc=0) and kept the token to prevent it;
that reasoning was sound *without* a name guard beside it and does not survive
having one. Silently doing more is the direction a guard must not drift in — but
here doing more is what the idiom means, and the alternative is not doing less, it
is exiting 1 on a correct invocation.

Consumed in `restartCmd` only. `parseDvaFlags` still keeps the terminator, because
`dva up` takes no positional names at all and relies on the surviving token to
reject a stray `--`. Dropping it centrally would newly accept one everywhere.

**All four tokens, ruled explicitly:**

| token | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `restart zzznosuchservice` | rc=0, nothing ran | **rc=1**, nothing ran |
| `restart -` | rc=0, nothing ran | **rc=1**, nothing ran |
| `restart -- --no-wat s1` | rc=0, **s1 ran, typo discarded** | **rc=1**, nothing ran |
| `restart --` | rc=0, nothing ran | rc=0/rc=1, **whatever a bare `restart` does here** |

The first three are one class — after `--` a token is a name whatever it spells, so
one name-shaped check answers all three. The fourth moves in the other direction
and is the only row where behaviour widens; that is the terminator consumption
above, and it makes `restart --` behave as a bare `restart` does in the same config.
The fourth row's "after" is deliberately not a fixed outcome: see the Review
correction below, where writing one down as if it were fixed is what produced the
one real defect this branch shipped and then removed.

Validated against `SortedStack()` — the **declared** entries, before tag filtering.
A name that exists but is excluded by `--tag` still selects nothing legitimately and
keeps its warning, so TASK-198's Open Question on the empty selection is untouched,
as this card requires.

`TestRestartBareTerminatorChangesNothing` was **renamed** to
`TestRestartBareTerminatorMeansABareRestart` (via a first, wrong
`…MeansEveryEntry`, see the Review correction); under this ruling the old name
asserts the opposite of what the test does. Its comment keeps 198's measured A/B table and
adds this card's row, so the inversion is visible in the diff rather than silent.

Two message defects surfaced by probing the built binary, both fixed in `71dcd3c`:
the headline read `unknown a stack entry name` (the noun was shared with
`rejectUnknownFlags`, which only ever drops it into a sentence), and `restart -`
suggested *both* `s1` and `s2`, since one character is two edits from any
two-character name. `similarTo` now also requires the distance to be shorter than
the input; `restart s3` still suggests both at distance 1.

## Verification (2026-08-20)

Branch `celee__fix__207-restart-unknown-name`, commits `9834ffc` (the ruling) and
`71dcd3c` (the message fixes), on `origin/master` = `8c48687`.

**The new tests can fail.** A/B with `restart_names_test.go` held byte-identical and
only `compose.go`/`selectors.go` reverted to `origin/master`: **10 of 12 subtests
FAIL**, plus both rewritten tests. The 2 that pass on master are the `restart -- s1`
row in each fixture — unchanged by design, since TASK-198 already fixed it — so they
are the positive control proving the guard did not break the working path, not a
vacuous pass.

**Against the built binary** (`bin/dva`, `Commit=9834ffc`, two-entry script fixture;
exit codes captured with no pipeline in the way):

```
restart zzznosuchservice  rc=1  ran=[]                              (was rc=0)
up      zzznosuchservice  rc=1  ran=[]                              (unchanged)
down    zzznosuchservice  rc=1  ran=[]                              (unchanged)
stop    zzznosuchservice  rc=1  ran=[]                              (unchanged)
restart -                 rc=1  ran=[]                              (was rc=0)
restart -- --no-wat s1    rc=1  ran=[]                              (was rc=0, s1 ran)
restart --                rc=0  ran=[s1_stop s1_up s2_stop s2_up]   (was rc=0, nothing)
restart -- s1             rc=0  ran=[s1_stop s1_up]                 (unchanged)
restart s1                rc=0  ran=[s1_stop s1_up]                 (unchanged)
```

Only the `restart` rows changed. The three sibling verbs are identical to the card's
Summary table, which is the point: restart moved to them, not they to it.

**Gates.** `go test ./internal/cli/ -count=1` ok. `make test` ok — 9 packages under
`-race`, cli coverage 74.6%. Card bindings re-measured after the disposition was
written: `dva stack up` references **0** (was 1), `func TestRestartUnknownNameRuling`
**1** (was 0), `writeRestartPlanProbeConfig` within 30 lines of it **1** (was 0).

## Review correction (2026-08-20) — `dec4e3e`

An adversarial review measured the Ruling's central claim false and it was right.
The claim was that consuming the terminator makes `dva restart --` *identical to a
bare `dva restart`*. Verified in the plan-less fixture only. In a config with
several plans and no `default_plan`:

```
dva restart        rc=1  multiple plans configured; specify one: dva restart <p1|p2>
dva restart --     rc=0  s1_stop s1_up s2_stop s2_up          ← before dec4e3e
```

So the terminator path did what the bare path is explicitly *refused*: TASK-198's
escalation, arriving from the other side. The cause is gate ordering, not the name
guard. `requirePlanSelection` runs on the **raw** args, where `["--"]` counts as "a
token was given" and passes; `dropFlagTerminator` then leaves zero names, which
lifecycle reads as "every entry". `dec4e3e` re-applies the gate, and the two agree again.
(That first attempt gated on the empty name list, which is *not* the terminator's
signature — see the second correction below.)

**The test asserted the divergence as correct.** `TestRestartUnknownNameRuling`'s
`the terminator alone` row hardcoded all four markers and ran under *both* fixtures,
so it measured the wrong behaviour and read it as agreement. A literal expectation
cannot catch this; the claim is about two invocations, so the assertion has to be
about two invocations. The row moved out of the table into
`TestRestartBareTerminatorMeansABareRestart`, which runs a bare `restart` and a
`restart --` in the same fixture and requires the same error text or the same
success, and the same markers. A/B with the plan gate removed and the test file
byte-identical: that test **FAILs on the plans fixture and passes on the plan-less
one**. The plans fixture is the one that must flip when the mechanism is removed;
the plan-less subtest staying green is the control that says the failure is the
mechanism and not the file.

**Re-measured, two binaries, `8c48687` vs `dec4e3e`** (sha256 differ; markers via a
script fixture):

```
                                     master 8c48687          final (f0abf944)
plans, no default   restart          rc=1 refused            rc=1 refused
plans, no default   restart --       rc=0 nothing            rc=1 refused  (now identical)
plans, no default   restart --tag T  rc=0 acts               rc=0 acts     (parity kept)
plans, no default   restart --mode --rc=0 nothing            rc=0 whole stack (see below)
no plans            restart          rc=0 whole stack        rc=0 whole stack
no plans            restart --       rc=0 nothing            rc=0 whole stack (the ruling)
default_plan: p1    restart          rc=0 p1 only            rc=0 p1 only
default_plan: p1    restart --       rc=1 refused            rc=1 refused (unchanged)
```

Row 2's master column read "rc=0 whole stack" until the second review corrected it.
That measurement belongs to `523f359`, this branch *before* the correction, not to
master: master leaves `--` in the name list, where it matches no entry, so it warns
and does nothing. Three binaries, sha256 recorded: master `2d8bc83e46a9` rc=0
nothing, pre-fix `7b82895e68f4` rc=0 whole stack, final `f0abf9449eeb` rc=1 refused.

**The default_plan shape is the one exception and it is pre-existing** — identical
on both binaries. `rejectSuppressedDefaultPlan` classifies any `args[0]` starting
with `-` as a flag, and `--` is not a flag. That helper is shared with
`up`/`down`/`stop`, so narrowing it from inside restart's card would decide three
other commands by accident — the trap TASK-198 recorded when it deferred this class
here. Opened as **TASK-210**, and the exception is now stated in `restart --help`
and in USAGE.md rather than left as a false identity claim.

Two smaller findings from the same review, both fixed in `dec4e3e`: a *second* `--`
was told to "move it before the `--`", meaningless advice for a token that is `--`
(it now gets its own line), and the dash rows asserted only that the message
contains `"-"`, true of most errors this command emits — the table now pins the
guard's own wording, so those rows cannot pass on someone else's error.

One finding was left out of scope and carded: a value-taking flag with no value is
silently dropped, so `dva restart --mode` restarts everything on master and here
alike. This branch adds a second spelling that reaches it (`--mode --`), which is
how it was noticed. **TASK-211**.

## Second review correction (2026-08-20) — the fix was too wide

Two independent reviews of `dec4e3e` — a subagent against the diff, a peer session
against two freshly built binaries — landed on the same class of defect from
different sides. All of it is fixed on this branch; measurements are against the
final binary `f0abf9449eeb` unless another sha is named.

**The gate refused nine shapes, not one.** `dec4e3e` guarded on `len(names) == 0`,
reading an empty name list as the terminator's signature. It is not: every stack
selector empties it too. Measured in a two-plan, no-`default_plan` config with
tagged entries:

```
                        master 8c48687        dec4e3e            final
restart --tag web       rc=0, s1 bounced      rc=1 refused       rc=0, s1 bounced
restart -T web          rc=0, s1 bounced      rc=1 refused       rc=0, s1 bounced
restart --exclude-tag   rc=0, s1 bounced      rc=1 refused       rc=0, s1 bounced
restart --mode dev      rc=1 "mode not found" rc=1 "plans"       rc=1 "mode not found"
up --tag web            rc=0                  rc=0               rc=0
stop --tag web          rc=0                  rc=0               rc=0
```

`up` and `stop` never changed, so `dec4e3e` made restart the one lifecycle verb
whose tag filter needed a plan name, and it answered "you mistyped a mode" with
"pick a plan". The gate is now applied to the raw args rather than to the name
list: strip `--debug`/`--json` as `requirePlanSelection` itself does, drop the
terminator, and require that nothing else survived. `TestRestartStackFlagsDoNotNeedAPlanName`
pins the two shapes against each other in one fixture — four selectors that must
act, and a bare `--` that must still be refused. Removing the gate fails the
terminator row; restoring the `len(names)` form fails the four selector rows.

**The help claimed a parity that does not exist.** `restart --help` said an
unknown name is an error "as it is for up, down and stop". None of the three ever
compares a token to the declared stack entries: `dva up s1` is rc=1 `plan 's1' not
found` even where `s1` is declared, and `down`/`stop` refuse positionals wholesale.
USAGE.md, edited in the same commit, said the opposite and was right. The help now
states the rule as restart's own.

**The default_plan exception was stated too narrowly.** `restart --help`, USAGE.md
and TASK-210 all scoped it to "a config with a `default_plan`". Measured in a
config with **one** plan and no `default_plan` key at all: `dva restart --` is
rc=1 `flags suppress the default plan "p1"` on master, `dec4e3e` and the final
binary alike, because `Config.DefaultPlan` treats a lone plan as the implicit
default. A reader who greps their `dva.yml` for the key and finds none would
conclude the exception does not apply. All three now say "a resolvable default
plan — an explicit `default_plan`, or a lone plan".

**The help documented only the reassuring half of the ruling.** "does what a bare
`dva restart` does" was followed by the refusal and not by the other consequence:
in a plan-less config it stops and starts every declared entry. `dva restart --
"$@"` with an empty `"$@"` was a no-op on master and is now either a whole-stack
bounce or rc=1 — neither is the old behaviour, and a wrapper script is exactly
where that matters. Both directions are now stated in `restart --help` and USAGE.md.

**The suggestion threshold was one-sided.** `d < len(s)`, added in `71dcd3c` to
stop `dva restart -` suggesting both `s1` and `s2`, left the mirror open: with a
one-character entry `b` declared, `dva restart wob` suggested it (d=2 against a
3-character input). It is now `d < min(len(s), len(c))`, with
`TestSimilarToWeighsBothNames` pinning both directions. The comment's claim that
the rule "costs the name caller nothing real" was wrong and is corrected there:
configs with one-character entry names get no suggestions at all, and the printed
list of declared entries is the fallback.

**One divergence from master is shipped deliberately.** `dva restart --mode --`
(and `--env --`, `--tag --`) is rc=0 whole stack here and rc=0 nothing on master.
The cause is TASK-211: the flag's value is swallowed by the terminator and the
flag is silently dropped, so the invocation reduces to "no names given", which the
ruling says means a bare restart. Master is not consistent here either — a bare
`dva restart --mode` already restarts everything on master — so this makes two
spellings of the same mistake agree rather than introducing a new rule. The honest
fix is TASK-211's, not another special case in this RunE.

**Two card defects found by the same reviews and fixed:** TASK-211 claimed `--var`
shares the missing-value defect. It does not — `--var` is handled in
`parsePlanFlags` (`plan_lifecycle.go:192`) and already errors `--var requires
KEY=VAL` on both binaries; `parseDvaFlags` has no `--var` case. Its cited range
`compose.go:762-780` was also off; the four value-taking cases span `764-783`. And
TASK-211's frontmatter quoted the very call-site count TASK-208 exists to retire.

## Technical Notes

Both fixtures used by the sweep behave identically, which is the point of
measuring both: `detectPlanRoute` returns `ok=false` for "no plans" *and* for
"several plans, none selected", so the stack path — and this defect — is
reachable with plans configured. The plans fixture is two plans (`p1`, `p2`) and
no `default_plan`; see `writeRestartPlanProbeConfig` in the test file, added by
TASK-198.

Exit codes must be captured without a pipeline in the way (`cmd >/dev/null 2>&1;
echo $?`). `cmd | head` reports head's status, and that has been misread as rc=0
twice in this repo's measurements.
