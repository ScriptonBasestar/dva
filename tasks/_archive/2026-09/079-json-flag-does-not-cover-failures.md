verification-summary: |
  Verified against bin/dva 0.1.44 (commit 15745f7) and current source; repo left clean (`git status --porcelain` empty).
  Both choke points exist and are wired: internal/cli/root.go:223 (Execute error block) and root.go:349 (mustLoadConfig, which os.Exit(1)s before Execute returns), both calling emitFailureJSON (root.go:330).
  Real-binary measurements: `app up myapp --json` → 1 doc, .error.message set, exit 1; `ls --json` with no dva.yml → jq -s length 1, .error.exit_code 1; both plain forms → 0 bytes on stdout.
  Message parity is byte-exact: cmp of stdout .error.message against the stderr ERROR body returns 0 (230 bytes each, dva init hint included).
  The yield condition holds on the real binary: `doctor --json` on a failing-check fixture gives exit 1, jq -s length 1, has("error") false, keys ["checks"], 2 failing checks present as positive control.
  `go test ./internal/cli/ -run JSON` passes and selects 20 top-level tests, so the regex is not matching an empty set.
  All five "Left open" items that owed work are now closed elsewhere: TASK-088 (validate --json) done, TASK-114 (output package tests) done — internal/output is now 100.0% statement coverage, TASK-080's `if jsonOutput { return }` gate present at internal/cli/gitignore.go (checkGitignoreForWarning).

# Task 079: Make the failure reachable through the flag that exists for machines

## Problem

`internal/cli/CLAUDE.md` describes `--json` as being for the LLM pipeline
("`--json` 플래그 → `output.go`의 JSON 포맷터 사용 (LLM 파이프라인용)"). Errors do not honour it.
`root.go:220` renders every error the same way whatever the flag says:

```go
if err := rootCmd.Execute(); err != nil {
    errMsg := err.Error()
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "\nERROR: %s\n", errMsg)
```

`gitignore.go:178` does the same for its warning.

## Evidence (verified 2026-07-30)

On a config with no `applications:` (the TASK-074 fixture), against `bin/dva` 0.1.44:

```
$ dva app up myapp --json    # stdout captured, stderr discarded
stdout=''  exit=1
$ dva app up --json          # the success side of the same command
stdout=''  exit=0
```

A consumer that pipes stdout to `jq` gets an empty document either way. The exit code is the
only signal, and it cannot say *why*.

## Why it matters

The flag's stated audience is a program, and a program cannot read `ERROR: …` on stderr without
parsing prose that no test pins. Every message this repo has recently made more actionable —
[TASK-073](073-version-error-blames-the-config-for-a-build-defect.md)'s build-vs-config
blame, [TASK-074](074-app-subcommands-answer-an-absent-section-three-ways.md)'s route —
is invisible to that audience.

Not P2: the human path works, and `--json` on the success path of commands that implement it
works. It is a gap in coverage, not a wrong answer.

## Shipped: one envelope, at both choke points, yielding to a document already there

Candidate (1) — the single choke point — with one correction the investigation forced. `root.go`
has **two** places a command dies, not one, and the second never reaches the first:
`mustLoadConfig` calls `os.Exit(1)` directly, so `rootCmd.Execute()` never returns and its error
block never runs. Fifteen commands reach a missing or unreadable config that way, which is the
most common failure a machine consumer will hit. Both now call `emitFailureJSON`.

Errors go to **stdout**, settling the open question in the old Fix-shape section. The task's own
acceptance criterion (`… | jq -e .error.message`, no redirection) already assumed stdout, and it
is the right assumption: stderr is where the human answer lives, and a consumer that wanted the
machine answer would have to demultiplex two formats from one stream to get it.

The condition worth naming is the second one. A command that already printed its document must
not get a second one appended:

| invocation | fixture | stdout | exit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dva app up myapp --json` | config with no `applications:` | **1 doc**, `.error.message` set | 1 |
| `dva app up myapp` | same | **0 bytes** | 1 |
| `dva ls --json` | no `dva.yml` anywhere (the `mustLoadConfig` path) | **1 doc**, `.error.message` set | 1 |
| `dva ls` | same | **0 bytes** | 1 |
| `dva doctor --json` | a `checks:` entry that must fail | **1 doc**, keys `checks`, no `error` | 1 |

Rows 1 and 3 were `0 bytes` before this change; row 5 is the one that decided the design.
`dva doctor --json` exits 1 while having already written a complete 488-byte `{"checks": …}`
object whose failing check *is* the failure. An envelope appended there would make stdout two
concatenated documents — Go's `encoding/json` rejects that with `invalid character '{' after
top-level value`, which is what the test asserts — so `internal/output` records that a printer has
written, and the envelope yields when it has.

**`jq` cannot be used to check this.** `jq` reads a *stream* of documents: `jq -e .` exits 0 on
two concatenated objects, so any "it parses" verdict built on it is vacuous. Measured:
`printf '{"a":1}{"b":2}' | jq -e .` exits 0, while `| jq -s 'length'` prints 2. Only the slurped
form counts documents, and only Go's `Unmarshal` rejects trailing data outright. Every
single-document claim below is backed by `jq -s 'length'` or by the Go test, never by `jq -e .`.

Candidate (2), per-command envelopes, stays rejected for the reason the task gave: it repeats one
decision N times, which is how TASK-074's five duplicated literals happened.

Stderr is byte-identical to before — the suggestion list and the `dva init` hint are untouched and
still human-only, per the non-goal.

## Non-goals

- Do not change any error's text. This is about the envelope.
- Do not add `--json` to commands that do not have it. Establish the failure shape first.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] A failed command under `--json` writes a parseable document to stdout | verify: `dva app up myapp --json 2>/dev/null | jq -e .error.message` — exits 0; was 4 (no output) before
- [x] The `mustLoadConfig` path is covered too, since it exits before `Execute` returns | verify: `cd <dir with no dva.yml> && dva ls --json 2>/dev/null | jq -s 'length'` — prints **1**; `.[0].error.message` carries the "could not find dva.yml" text with its `dva init` hint, `.[0].error.exit_code` is 1, command exit 1
- [x] It carries the message the human path prints | verify: `human — the stdout .error.message and the stderr ERROR: line were compared byte-for-byte on the same invocation and are identical, hint line included`
- [x] Success output under `--json` is unchanged | verify: `go test ./internal/cli/ -run JSON` — passes; 17 pre-existing JSON tests selected besides the new one, so the regex is not matching an empty set
- [x] Without `--json` nothing moves to stdout | verify: `test -z "$(dva app up myapp 2>/dev/null)"` — captured value was `''`, 0 bytes; `dva ls` without the flag likewise yields `jq` exit 4
- [x] A command that already printed its document does not get a second one | verify: `dva doctor --json 2>/dev/null | jq -s 'length'` on a failing-check fixture — prints 1, `has("error")` is false, exit still 1
- [x] Not vacuous | verify: `human — three mutations, each caught: drop the already-printed guard → doctor's stdout fails to parse; drop the --json guard → the plain path emits; stop recording the write in PrintJSON → the concatenation subtest fails`
- [x] Full suite passes under -race | verify: `make test`

## Left open

- **`dva validate --json` never reads `jsonOutput`** — but the envelope covers more of it than
  this entry originally claimed. Measured after the fix: a load failure and a schema failure each
  yield one document with `.error.message` and exit 1, because `validate` returns an error and
  this envelope catches it. What stays prose is everything `validate` says for itself — the
  `✅ dva.yml is valid` verdict and every `[warn] semantic:` line, which under `--json` are
  byte-identical to the run without the flag. The original wording ("returns no error, so the
  envelope never applies") holds only for the success path. Now filed with the four measured paths
  as [TASK-088](088-validate-json-covers-only-the-failure-it-does-not-produce.md).
- **The suggestion list and the `dva init` hint stay human-only.** `did_you_mean` and the init
  hint are printed after the envelope, to stderr. Keeping them out of the document follows the
  non-goal ("Do not change any error's text"), and the actionable content lives in `message`
  itself, which travels. If a consumer ever needs the alternatives as data, that is a schema
  question, not a rendering one.
- **Commands with no `--json` support still print human output on stdout when they succeed.**
  Only the failure path is now uniform. Establishing the success shape was explicitly a non-goal.
- **`internal/output` has no test file** (0.0% coverage). `StdoutHasDocument` and
  `ResetStdoutDocument` are exercised from `internal/cli`, which is where the behaviour that
  needs pinning lives, but the package's own printers remain untested.
- **`status.go`'s hazard path was not reached end-to-end.** An independent survey found exactly
  two sites that write a JSON document to stdout and can still return a non-nil error afterwards:
  `doctor.go:51-56` and `status.go:57-60` (`PrintJSON` then `lifecycle.StatusExitError`). `doctor`
  is confirmed on the real binary — a failing `checks:` entry gives exit 1, `jq -s 'length'` = 1,
  `has("error")` false, with 4 failing checks present as a positive control. `status` needs a
  stack entry carrying a non-empty `Error`, which needs a live runtime; in a docker-less
  environment it reported no error and exited 0, so its guard is covered by construction (the
  record lives in `PrintJSON`, which both call) but not by measurement.
- **`gitignore.go:178` left this task's scope.** [TASK-080](080-gitignore-warning-preempts-every-command.md)
  shipped the `if jsonOutput { return }` gate, so the warning no longer contaminates a `--json`
  stream and nothing is owed here.
