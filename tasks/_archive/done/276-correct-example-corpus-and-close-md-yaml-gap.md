# Task 276: correct example corpus and close the markdown/YAML gate gap

## Summary

The tracked example corpus contains commands that error and a config shape that fails to
parse, one of which is a safety-relevant misstatement about when DVA prompts before
destroying data; and the schema test that is supposed to catch this class of defect only
walks `*.yml` files, so none of the errors embedded in markdown were ever caught. This task
fixes the confirmed corpus defects and extends the gate so the same class of defect cannot
recur silently.

**This card is startable now.** It declared `depends-on: [TASK-266]` because both cards touch
`examples/`, and TASK-266 is still open on its Stage B release gate — which made this one read
as blocked for as long as 0.1.48 has not shipped. The dependency was only ever about the shared
files, and TASK-266 **Stage A** already cleared them in `c6aa64b`: `examples/env-file-priority.yml`
now declares `env_file:` at the root only, with no interaction-level copy, and the
"Command-specific env_file" section is gone from `examples/README.md`
(verify: `/usr/bin/grep -n env_file examples/env-file-priority.yml` and
`/usr/bin/grep -c 'Command-specific' examples/README.md`). Stage B touches the schema and the Go
types, not `examples/`. The declaration was therefore dropped on 2026-09-03; the Non-goals below
still hold and still mark those two files out of scope, so a session working this card must not
edit them even though nothing now blocks the rest.

## Problem

> The quoted strings are the authoritative anchors; locate each defect by string, not by line.

### Half A — corpus defects

1. **Safety-relevant**: `README.md:87` states, in the Lifecycle bullet, that both `` `down
   -v` `` and `` `--purge` `` destructive teardowns go through a confirmation prompt
   ("`down -v`·`--purge` 같은 파괴적 teardown은 확인 프롬프트를 거칩니다"). `confirmDestruction`
   (`internal/cli/confirm.go:50`) has exactly one call site,
   `internal/cli/plan_lifecycle.go:417`, gated on the `--purge` flag alone. `dva down <plan>
   -v` with no `--purge` deletes volumes with **no prompt at all**. The README currently tells
   a reader that `-v` alone is safe-guarded when it is not.

2. `examples/MAKEFILE.md:160` documents `dva --version`. `rootCmd` sets no `Version:` field
   (confirmed absent from `internal/cli/root.go`), so cobra never registers a `--version`
   flag; the only working invocation is the `version` subcommand
   (`internal/cli/version.go:12-13`, wired at `root.go:111`). `dva --version` errors.

3. `examples/MAKEFILE.md` (around line 41-44) documents:
   ```yaml
   provision:
     - dva compose up -d postgres redis
     - dva bundle install
     - dva rails db:setup
   ```
   `ProvisionConfig.UnmarshalYAML` (`internal/config/config.go:481-483`) requires the
   `provision:` value to be a YAML mapping (`node.Kind != yaml.MappingNode` is a hard error);
   a bare sequence does not parse.

4. `examples/DISCOURSE.md` and `examples/provision-step-syntax.yml` were swept for the same
   class of error (removed commands/sections, unparseable provision shape). Both are clean:
   `provision-step-syntax.yml`'s `provision:` block already uses the flat `<profile>:
   [ProvisionItem, ...]` shape the real type expects, and `DISCOURSE.md` contains no reference
   to a removed command or section. No changes needed in either file.

### Half B — gate gap

5. `internal/config/examples_schema_test.go:12-19` walks `examplesDir()` filtering
   `filepath.Ext(path) != ".yml"` — it validates every `examples/*.yml` file against the
   schema but has no path that ever looks inside a `.md` file. The `provision:` sequence
   defect in item 3 lives entirely inside a fenced YAML block in `examples/MAKEFILE.md` and is
   invisible to this test by construction; the same is true of any future config-shape defect
   introduced inside example markdown.

6. Measured at this HEAD: running `dva config validate --strict` against each of the 16 files
   in `examples/*.yml` (each copied alone into an empty directory, since none of the tracked
   examples ships its referenced compose file), 15 of 16 fail — all 15 with a "section order"
   semantic warning, most also with a config-drift warning for a referenced compose file that
   does not exist in the repo. Only `examples/stack-source.yml` passes `--strict` cleanly.
   `skills/dva/references/patterns.md:26` instructs agents to run `dva config validate
   --strict` as the last step of its Standard Workflow — an agent following that guidance
   against most of the tracked examples gets a non-zero exit from the corpus it was told to
   model.

## Completion Criteria

- [x] The README Lifecycle bullet states that only `--purge` (not `-v` alone) triggers the confirmation prompt, matching `confirmDestruction`'s single `--purge`-gated call site | verify: `human — read the bullet against confirmDestruction's call site; the sentence must not leave a reader believing bare -v is guarded`
- [x] `examples/MAKEFILE.md` uses `dva version` in place of the non-existent `dva --version` flag | verify: `! /usr/bin/grep -q -- 'dva --version' examples/MAKEFILE.md`
- [x] `examples/MAKEFILE.md`'s `provision:` example is rewritten as a mapping (`default_profile` plus a flat `<profile>: [ProvisionItem, ...]` list, or a bare `<profile-name>:` key holding the list) that unmarshals against `ProvisionConfig.UnmarshalYAML` | verify: human — reviewer copies the corrected block into a scratch `dva.yml` and confirms `dva config validate` does not reject it as unparseable
- [x] `internal/config/examples_schema_test.go` (or a sibling test) extracts fenced YAML code blocks from `examples/*.md` and validates each against the same schema/semantic path used for `examples/*.yml`, so a defect like item 3 fails a test instead of shipping silently | verify: `go test ./internal/config -count=1`
- [x] Every file in `examples/*.yml` passes `dva config validate --strict` with **zero warnings other than the two documented compose-absence strings** (`compose.files is ... but detected root compose files are (none)` and `compose file "..." is configured by dva.yml but does not exist`), which the ruling below exempts as a property of a fragment corpus rather than a defect in it | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -Eq '^func TestExamplesStrictCleanExceptComposeAbsence\(' internal/config/examples_schema_test.go && go test ./internal/config -count=1 -run TestExamplesStrictCleanExceptComposeAbsence`
- [x] The exemption lives in the corpus test, not in `validate --strict` itself — running `dva config validate --strict` on a real project that names a missing compose file still warns | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -Eq '^func TestStrictStillWarnsOnMissingComposeOutsideCorpus\(' internal/config/validate_test.go && go test ./internal/config -count=1 -run TestStrictStillWarnsOnMissingComposeOutsideCorpus`
- [x] `examples/README.md`'s `**Last Updated**` footer states the file's actual last-change date instead of `March 2026` | verify: `! /usr/bin/grep -q 'Last Updated.*March 2026' examples/README.md`
- [x] `examples/README.md`'s ambiguous `**Version**: 0.1.44` footer is relabelled to say which claim it makes, so no future sweep has to guess between "docs describe 0.1.44" and "these configs require at least 0.1.44" | verify: `! /usr/bin/grep -Eq '^\*\*Version\*\*: 0\.1\.44' examples/README.md`
- [x] Repository gates pass | verify: `make lint && make test && make doc-check`

## Non-goals

- `examples/env-file-priority.yml`'s interaction-level `env_file` declarations and the
  "Command-specific env_file" section of `examples/README.md` are owned by
  [TASK-266](266-deprecate-and-reject-interaction-env-file.md) and are out of scope here —
  do not touch either as part of this task.
- No change to `confirmDestruction`'s gating behaviour. This is not a deferral: `-v` and
  `--purge` have different reach, and the prompt asymmetry follows that difference exactly.
  `-v` removes named volumes and nothing else, which is what the flag says and what
  `docker compose down -v` means — typing it is the consent. `--purge` additionally removes
  locally built images and every provision marker in the config directory, reaching outside
  the plan the user named, which is what the prompt guards. The gating condition is correct;
  only the README sentence is wrong. See PLAN-004's 검토 종료된 항목 for the full record —
  **do not add a prompt to the `-v` path.**
- No change to `ProvisionConfig.UnmarshalYAML` or any other runtime type — corpus and docs are
  brought into agreement with the existing parser, not the other way around.
- No new example files beyond what's needed to demonstrate a corrected provision shape in
  `examples/MAKEFILE.md`. In particular, the fourteen absent compose files are **not** authored
  here — see the ruling above.
- `service-orchestration.yml`'s overlay-modelling warning is owned by
  [TASK-288](288-model-compose-overlays-in-service-orchestration-example.md) and is out of scope.

## Troubleshooting Log

- Section-order and config-drift warning counts were measured by copying each
  `examples/*.yml` file alone into an empty scratch directory as `dva.yml` and running `dva
  config validate --strict` there, since the repository does not ship compose files alongside
  these examples. This mirrors how the tracked corpus actually ships (no sibling compose
  files exist under `examples/`), so the drift warnings are not an artifact of the
  measurement method.
- Symptom: text-preserving reorder of top-level `examples/*.yml` sections silently dropped
  blank lines between sections. Cause: first script split the file via `text.split("\n")`
  and rejoined section slices with `"\n".join(...)`, which loses the separating blank line
  that belonged to neither slice. Fix: rewrote the reorder step to operate on raw text with
  `re.finditer` + character-offset slicing instead of a line-list join, preserving whitespace
  byte-for-byte; re-verified via `diff` against the pre-edit file. ~20 min.
- Symptom: fixing `applications.yml`'s "interaction.db has subcommands but is not directly
  callable" warning by adding both `service:` and `command:` to the parent `db:` node
  introduced a new "subcommand.shell.command is identical to parent; subcommand is
  redundant" warning. Cause: the added parent `command:` exactly matched the `shell`
  subcommand's `command:`. Fix: kept only `service: postgres` on the parent (confirmed via
  `hasExecutionTarget()` in `internal/config/validate_warnings.go` that a bare `service:` is
  sufficient to count as an execution target), dropping the duplicate `command:`. ~10 min.
- Not fixed, by design: compose-file-existence drift warnings remain on 14/16
  `examples/*.yml` files (all but `kubernetes.yml`/`stack-source.yml`), because no tracked
  example ships its referenced compose file. Considered three fixes and rejected all: (1)
  flat sidecar files collide on the shared name `docker-compose.yml` across examples: (2)
  uniquely-named sidecars aren't recognized by `detectComposeFilesInDir`'s naming
  heuristic, so the mismatch warning persists anyway; (3) per-example subdirectories would
  be a structural repo change touching paths referenced by README.md, DISCOURSE.md, runner
  tests, and other concurrently-edited cards — out of this card's scope. Left unresolved
  with this reasoning recorded for the next card that wants to pick it up.
- Not fixed, by design: `service-orchestration.yml` still reports a "merge infra-compose and
  frontend into one entry" warning because both reference the same compose file. The
  suggested merge would collapse `frontend`'s `order: 40`/`depends_on: [api]` into
  `infra-compose`'s `order: 10`, changing the ordered-startup behavior the example exists to
  demonstrate. Left unresolved rather than mechanically applying a fix that changes what the
  example teaches.

## Orchestrator measurement (2026-09-03, batch run)

Criterion 5 (`examples/*.yml` strict-clean) was measured rather than accepted from the
implementer's report. Each `examples/*.yml` was copied into its own scratch directory as
`dva.yml` and validated there, since `dva config validate` takes no file flag and reads the
`dva.yml` in its working directory:

```
clean=2 dirty=14 total=16   # 14 files exit 1 with 2-4 warnings each
```

Only `kubernetes.yml` and `stack-source.yml` are clean. The criterion demands zero warnings
for all 16, so it is **not met** and this card stays in `todo`.

A first measurement attempt used `dva config validate --strict -f <file>` and reported
`clean=16`. That was a false pass: `-f` is not a registered flag, every invocation exited 1
with `unknown shorthand flag: 'f'`, and the warning-count grep found nothing in the error
text. Recorded because the same shape — a grep count over output from a command that never
ran — will pass any criterion bound this way.

Criteria 2, 4 and 6 were executed and pass. Criteria 1 and 3 are human-bound and carry the
implementer's assertion, not an orchestrator verification.

## Criterion 5 is a scope decision, not fourteen fixes (2026-09-03, batch review)

The 14 strict failures are not fourteen independent drifts. Thirteen of them are the same
warning pair — `compose.files is docker-compose.yml but detected root compose files are
(none)` and `compose file "docker-compose.yml" is configured by dva.yml but does not exist`
— and they fire for a reason that is a property of the corpus rather than a defect in the
files:

- **No compose file has ever existed under `examples/`.** Every path ever tracked there,
  across all history, is a dva.yml sample, a dva module under `modules/.sb/dva/`, or a
  markdown doc. Verified with `git log --all --name-only -- examples | sort -u` (no
  pathspec globs, so nothing is hidden by a glob that failed to match).
- **`examples/README.md` says the examples are meant to be adapted, not run.** Its "Using
  These Examples" workflow is copy → customize → validate, and the customize step names
  "Service names in docker-compose.yml" as the reader's job. The reader supplies the compose
  file; the example never claimed to.

So criterion 5's first branch — "ship the referenced compose files" — would author fourteen
compose files that exist only to satisfy a validator, and would contradict the workflow the
corpus documents for itself. The second branch, "adjust the examples so config-drift warnings
do not fire", means removing the `compose.files:` references that are the entire point of a
compose example.

What this card actually needs is the decision it has been standing in for: **are examples
illustrative fragments or runnable trees?** If fragments (which the evidence above says they
already are), the resolution is to say so — exempt the corpus from the strict compose-drift
check, or teach the check that a template referencing an absent compose file is not drift —
and criterion 5 should be rewritten to match. If some subset is meant to be runnable, then
the split and its rationale matter, not the count.

The remaining warning is a different defect with a different owner: `service-orchestration.yml`
draws one `semantic:` warning saying its four compose entries "can run in the same invocation
set", so an overlay entry cannot patch another entry's services. That is about how the example
models overlays, has nothing to do with missing files, and the mechanical fix (merge into one
entry) would collapse the ordered startup the example exists to demonstrate.

Framing credit: raised by a peer session reviewing the same corpus; the discriminator
(has any example ever shipped a compose file / does any doc promise runnability) is theirs,
the measurement is this session's.

## 판정: examples는 실행 트리가 아니라 예시 조각이다 (2026-09-03)

바로 위 절이 "이 카드가 실제로 필요한 것은 대신 서 있던 결정이다 — examples는 illustrative
fragment인가 runnable tree인가"라고 물었다. **fragment로 확정한다.** 세 개의 독립 증거가 같은
방향을 가리키고 반대 증거가 없다:

1. `examples/` 아래에 compose 파일이 존재한 적이 **한 번도 없다** — 전 히스토리 대상
   `git log --all --name-only -- examples` 결과가 dva.yml 샘플, `modules/.sb/dva/` 모듈,
   markdown 문서뿐이다.
2. `examples/README.md`가 스스로 "Using These Examples" 워크플로를 copy → customize →
   validate로 서술하며, customize 단계에서 "Service names in docker-compose.yml"을 **독자의
   몫**으로 명시한다. compose 파일은 독자가 공급한다.
3. README step 3의 walkthrough(`DVA_FILE=examples/basic.yml dva validate`)는 수정하지 않은
   예시를 검증만 하고 **실행하지 않는다**. 문서화된 수명주기가 `validate`에서 끝난다.

증거가 이미 사실을 확정하고 있으므로 이 항목을 `needs-human`으로 올리지 않는다. 사람이
고를 것이 남아 있으려면 두 답이 모두 살아 있어야 하는데, "runnable"을 뒷받침하는 증거가
저장소 어디에도 없다.

### 따라서 무엇을 고치는가 — 검증기가 아니라 corpus 측정 방식

카드가 제시한 두 갈래는 둘 다 기각한다. compose 파일 14개를 저자하는 것은 validator를
달래려고만 존재하는 파일을 만드는 일이고, `compose.files:` 참조를 지우는 것은 compose 예시의
존재 이유를 지우는 일이다.

세 번째 선택지를 택한다: **`--strict`의 compose-absence 경고는 그대로 두고, corpus 게이트만
그 두 문자열을 예외 처리한다.** 근거는 그 경고가 **실제 프로젝트에서는 옳기 때문이다** —
존재하지 않는 compose 파일을 가리키는 dva.yml은 진짜 결함이다. 경고가 틀린 것은 오직 템플릿에
대해서일 뿐이다. validator를 약화시키면 fragment corpus 하나를 통과시키려고 모든 사용자의
진짜 경고를 끈다. 그래서 예외는 사용자 표면이 아니라 측정 쪽에 둔다. 새 기준 두 줄이 그 경계를
양방향으로 못박는다 — corpus는 예외를 받고, corpus 밖은 계속 경고한다.

### 남는 하나는 이 카드의 것이 아니다

`service-orchestration.yml`의 semantic 경고(네 compose 엔트리가 같은 invocation set에 들어가
overlay가 다른 엔트리를 patch하지 못한다)는 파일 부재와 무관한 별개 결함이고, 기계적 수정
(엔트리 병합)은 예시가 가르치려는 순서 있는 기동을 무너뜨린다. [TASK-288](288-model-compose-overlays-in-service-orchestration-example.md)로
분리했다. 이 카드는 그것을 기다리지 않는다.

## Trap for the examples/*.md sweep: `version:` is a floor, not a stamp

Anyone sweeping `examples/` for version consistency will find `version: "0.1.44"` in
`examples/README.md:157`, `DISCOURSE.md:121`, and `MAKEFILE.md:19` while the repo is at
0.1.47, and read it as drift. **It is not, and bumping it is a defect.**
`internal/config/version.go` declares `const MinScaffoldVersion = "0.1.44"` with the reason
written out: `version:` states what a config requires of its reader, not which binary wrote
it, so scaffolding the running version "would make every new config refuse to load on any
older DVA, ratcheting the floor upward on each release". Raising these lines silently raises
every example's compatibility floor and erases the distinction the const exists to hold.

Two things in `examples/README.md` are genuinely different claims and were checked separately:

- `**Last Updated**: March 2026` (line ~366) is **wrong**. The file was last changed
  2026-09-03 (`c6aa64b`), and before that 2026-08-01 (`c50c5a1`). Stale by about six months.
- `**Version**: 0.1.44` (line ~365) is **ambiguous and was deliberately left alone**. It sits
  in a doc-metadata footer beside "Last Updated", so it may mean "these docs describe DVA
  0.1.44" — a stale doc stamp — or it may be echoing the compatibility floor, in which case
  it is correct. The line alone does not say which, and guessing wrong walks straight into
  the trap above. Whoever resolves this should decide what the footer is claiming before
  touching the number.

Also verified while here, because the walkthrough these lines sit in is what criterion 5
implicitly leans on: README step 3's `DVA_FILE=examples/basic.yml dva validate` is accurate on
both halves. `DVA_FILE` is real (`internal/config/constants.go`, `EnvFileKey`), and
`dva validate` is a genuine alias — its own help says "Reached as both 'dva validate' and
'dva config validate'". Note what that walkthrough does: it validates an unmodified example
in place and never runs one. The README's documented lifecycle for an untouched example
terminates at `validate`, which is a third piece of evidence for the scope finding above —
criterion 5 asks the corpus for a property the README's own procedure never exercises.

Trap and the walkthrough observation raised by a peer session; verification is this session's.
