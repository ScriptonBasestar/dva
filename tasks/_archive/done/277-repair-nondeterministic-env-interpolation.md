# Task 277: repair nondeterministic env_file interpolation order

## Summary

A value that interpolates a variable declared earlier in the same `.env` file resolves
differently from run to run. The declaration order of a dotenv file is discarded during
parsing, so whether `${A}` is in scope when `B=${A}-derived` is stored depends on Go's
randomized map iteration. The user-visible effect is that the same `dva.yml` and the same
`.env` files produce different environment values on different invocations.

This is a correctness defect in the load path, not only a flaky test. It was found while
running TASK-246's gates and is unrelated to that card's changes — it reproduces on a clean
`master` working tree.

## Problem

`parseEnvFileStrict` (`internal/config/envfile.go`) returns `map[string]string`, which
carries no declaration order:

```
grep -n 'func parseEnvFileStrict' internal/config/envfile.go
```

`ApplyEnvFiles` (`internal/config/envinput.go`) then merges each entry's map and
interpolates once at the end:

```
grep -n 'env.MergeVars(entry.vars)' internal/config/envinput.go
```

but the effective interpolation happens *earlier*, inside `MergeVars`, per value, while
ranging over that unordered map:

```
grep -n 'e.Vars\[k\] = e.Interpolate(v)' internal/config/environment.go
```

So for `a.env` containing `A=first` and `B=${A}-derived`:

- if `A` is visited first, `B` stores `first-derived`;
- if `B` is visited first, `${A}` is unresolved and `B` stores `${A}-derived`, which the
  final `interpolateEnvVars` pass later resolves against whatever `A` ended up as — including
  a value from a *later* file.

Reproduced on a clean `master` (`1e36b15`, no local modifications), 30 sequential runs:

```
$ for i in $(seq 1 30); do go test ./internal/config \
    -run TestLoadEnvFileKeepsSuccessfulPrecedence -count=1 >/dev/null 2>&1 \
    && echo pass || echo fail; done | sort | uniq -c
  27 pass
   3 fail
```

The failing assertion is `envinput_test.go:168`:

```
B = "second-derived", want interpolation against the value in scope when it was declared
```

`TestLoadEnvFileKeepsSuccessfulPrecedence` therefore already documents the intended
semantics — "interpolation against the value in scope when it was declared" — and the
implementation only satisfies them by luck.

### The blast radius is wider than the one flaking test

`MergeVars` is the shared merge primitive, not an `env_file`-only helper. Non-test call
sites, measured on `c6aa64b`:

```
grep -rn 'MergeVars(' --include='*.go' . | grep -v _test
```

21 matching lines, of which one is the declaration (`internal/config/environment.go:71`)
and one is a comment reference (`internal/lifecycle/resolver.go:382`) — **19 real call
sites**. They span `internal/config/envinput.go:247`, `internal/config/environment.go:52`,
six in `internal/lifecycle/orchestrator.go`, four in `internal/cli/compose.go`, and
`internal/cli/build.go:123`, `internal/cli/run.go:84`/`:140`,
`internal/cli/validate.go:409`/`:446`, `internal/cli/plan_runtime.go:47`,
`internal/cli/root.go:469`.

`interpolateEnvVars` has exactly **one** non-test call site — `internal/config/envinput.go:250`,
immediately after the `ApplyEnvFiles` merge loop:

```
grep -rn 'interpolateEnvVars(' --include='*.go' . | grep -v _test
```

That asymmetry changes what the defect is. `Interpolate` returns the literal `${VAR}` match
when the name is not in scope (`internal/config/environment.go`, the `// Return original if
not found` branch), so a value that loses the map-iteration race is stored **unresolved**.
On the `env_file` path the trailing `interpolateEnvVars(env)` pass repairs it — badly, by
resolving against the final merged map instead of declaration scope, which is the (A)/(B)
divergence above. On the other 18 call sites there is no repair pass at all: plan `vars`,
entry `vars`, mode `environment`, and exports that reference a sibling key declared in the
same batch keep the literal `${VAR}` **permanently**.

So the observable failure is not "the value is sometimes one thing and sometimes the other".
On most paths one of the two outcomes is an uninterpolated string handed to a child process.

Independent reproduction on clean `master`: 40 runs → 5 failures (a second session), against
the 30 runs → 3 failures recorded above. Both sample the same defect.

Consequence for the fix: whichever semantics is chosen, fixing only `ApplyEnvFiles` leaves
the other 18 call sites nondeterministic. The repair has to land in `MergeVars` itself, or
`MergeVars` has to stop being handed an unordered map.

## Decision taken: (A) declaration-order scope

The test names one semantics; the code implements two, nondeterministically. Fixing this
means picking one and stating it:

- **(A) Declaration-order scope** — a value interpolates against what is in scope at the
  point it is declared, so an earlier file's derived value is not retroactively rewritten by
  a later file. This is what the existing test asserts and what dotenv/Compose users expect.
- **(B) Post-merge scope** — all files merge first, then everything interpolates against the
  final map. Simpler, but makes `B` in an early file silently depend on a later file, and
  contradicts the existing test.

(A) is the recommended reading: it is the one already written down, and (B) would require
rewriting a test that was added deliberately to pin the behavior.

**(A) was implemented** (2026-09-03). The card carries no `needs-human` flag and the
recommendation was unambiguous, so this was taken as a routine judgement call rather than
held for a decision round; if (B) was actually wanted, the two tests named below are the
places that say otherwise and would have to be rewritten.

### How (A) was realized, and where it diverges from a literal reading

The criteria offered two routes — carry declaration order through parsing, or stop making an
interpolation decision while ranging an unordered map. The second was taken, because only it
reaches all 19 call sites: dotenv parsing is the one place where an order exists to be
preserved, while a YAML `environment:` block never had one.

`MergeVars` now resolves a batch by **dependency** rather than by iteration order. A value
referencing a sibling always sees that sibling's merged value, whichever order the range
visits them in. Resolution is memoized, with an in-progress guard so that a reference closing
a cycle, including a key referring to itself, falls back to the pre-merge environment;
`e.Vars` is written only after the whole batch resolves, so a cycle never reads a
half-applied batch. The OS-environment check runs first and takes the whole entry, unchanged
from before: a key the OS defines never has its declared value examined, so it is never
resolved on a sibling's behalf either, and a batch's `${K}` cannot disagree with the final
`e.Vars[K]`. A consequence worth stating because it reads like something the guard fixes and
is not: `PATH=${PATH}:/x` in a dotenv file does not append to PATH, and did not before this
change — PATH is in the OS environment, so the declaration is discarded before the guard is
reachable. The top-level walk is sorted, which does nothing for acyclic data and
exists only to pin the answer for a genuine mutual cycle, where no starting point is more
correct than another.

This is (A) at the granularity that matters — a batch resolves when it merges, and a later
batch redefining the source does not reach back and rewrite an earlier batch's derived value.
It is *not* literal declaration-order scope within a single file: `B=${A}` written above
`A=first` resolves to `first` here, where strict positional scope would leave it unresolved.
That divergence is deliberate. Positional scope is only definable for the one input that has
positions, so enforcing it would mean two different semantics depending on whether the batch
came from a file or from YAML — and the failure it would produce (an unresolved `${A}`
reaching a child process) is the exact failure this card exists to remove.

## Completion Criteria

- [x] Dotenv declaration order survives parsing — the parse result carries order, or merge consumes the file in declaration order rather than ranging over an unordered map, so no interpolation decision is made while ranging an unordered map | verify: `! /usr/bin/grep -q 'e.Vars\[k\] = e.Interpolate(v)' internal/config/environment.go`
- [x] `MergeVars` no longer interpolates while ranging over an unordered map, or is fed an ordered sequence | verify: `go test ./internal/config -count=1`
- [x] `TestLoadEnvFileKeepsSuccessfulPrecedence` passes deterministically — 50 consecutive runs, zero failures | verify: `go test ./internal/config -run TestLoadEnvFileKeepsSuccessfulPrecedence -count=50`
- [x] A regression test pins the chosen semantics explicitly for the two-file case (`A` redefined by a later file, `B` derived from `A` in the earlier one) so a future refactor cannot silently switch between (A) and (B) | verify: `go test ./internal/config -count=1`
- [x] Multi-key single-file interpolation is order-stable under repeated runs, not only the two-key case | verify: `go test ./internal/config -count=20`
- [x] The whole package is clean and race-free | verify: `go test -race ./internal/config -count=1`

## Evidence

`internal/config/environment.go` — `MergeVars` rewritten; `Interpolate` split into
`interpolateWith(value, lookup)` + `(*Environment).lookup`, behavior unchanged.

`internal/config/environment_merge_order_test.go` — new:

- `TestMergeVarsResolvesSiblingReferencesRegardlessOfMapOrder` — a 7-key chain merged 200
  times through `MergeVars` alone, with no repair pass behind it. This is the test that
  covers the 18 call sites `interpolateEnvVars` never reaches.
- `TestMergeVarsKeepsDeclarationScopeAcrossBatches` — the (A)/(B) pin. Under (B) the derived
  value would read `second-derived`.
- `TestMergeVarsSelfReferenceReadsPreMergeValue` — a key referring to itself, where the OS
  does not define it.
- `TestMergeVarsOSEnvShadowsSelfReferentialDeclaration` — the other half: where the OS *does*
  define it, the declaration is dropped whole. Pins pre-existing behavior the rewrite had to
  leave alone, and keeps the ordering claim in the `MergeVars` comment from going
  unverified.
- `TestMergeVarsMutualCycleIsDeterministic` — 200 runs, same answer; a cycle has no right
  answer but must not be a source of run-to-run drift.
- `TestMergeVarsOSEnvStillWinsOverBatch` — precedence carried through the rewrite, both for
  the merged key and for a referenced name.
- `TestLoadEnvFileMultiKeyChainIsOrderStable` — 9-key chain, 50 runs, end-to-end through
  `LoadEnvFile` so the trailing repair pass is in play.

Fixture keys are `T277_`-prefixed on purpose: `MergeVars` gives the OS environment priority,
so a bare `A` exported in the shell running `go test` would take the assertions over
silently.

## Notes

Owner coordination: the parse/merge path in `envinput.go` arrived with TASK-248
(`b23780e`, "feat(cli): enforce required env policy per command route"). This card does not
change the failure-reporting behavior that card froze — only the order in which loaded
values are applied.

## Review Log

독립 리뷰 (2026-09-07, 구현자 아님). 재실행한 것:

- 완료기준 6개 바인딩 전부 직접 실행 — `! grep -q 'e.Vars[k] = e.Interpolate(v)'` (exit 0),
  `go test ./internal/config -count=1`, `-run TestLoadEnvFileKeepsSuccessfulPrecedence -count=50`,
  `-count=20`, `go test -race ./internal/config -count=1`. 전부 통과, 실패 0.
- 구현 diff `e9ce4e6` 및 후속 `d7636a3`를 읽고 현재 `internal/config/environment.go`와 대조.

diff가 실제로 한 일: `MergeVars`가 map range 중 보간하던 것을 memoized dependency 해석으로
교체했고, in-progress guard가 cycle을 pre-merge 스코프로 떨어뜨린다. `e.Vars`는 배치 전체가
해석된 뒤 `maps.Copy`로 한 번에 쓰므로 half-applied 배치를 읽는 경로가 없다. 최상위 walk가
`slices.Sorted`인 것은 상호 cycle의 답을 고정하기 위한 것으로 카드 설명과 일치한다.
`environment_merge_order_test.go`의 7개 테스트는 실제 동작(200회 반복, OS env shadow, 자기참조,
배치 간 (A) 시맨틱)을 단언하며, 코드가 돌았다는 것만 확인하는 형태가 아니다.

적대적으로 확인한 것: (a) cycle에서 memo가 pre-merge 값을 캐싱하는 것은 cycle 고유의 성질이며
카드가 명시함, (b) OS env가 정의한 키를 형제 대신 해석하지 않음 —
`TestMergeVarsOSEnvShadowsSelfReferentialDeclaration`이 핀으로 잡고 있음, (c) 배치에 없는 이름은
`e.lookup`으로 떨어져 기존 동작 유지. 결함 없음.

**판정: pass.**
