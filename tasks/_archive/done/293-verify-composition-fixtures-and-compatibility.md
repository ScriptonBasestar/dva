# Task 293: verify composition fixtures and compatibility

## Summary

Close the loop TASK-289 through TASK-292 opened: prove the full composition feature — schema, resolver,
runtime, and CLI together — reproduces every fixture TASK-260 requires, and prove it changes nothing for
configurations that do not use `composes:`.

## Recommended direction

Build the two-project fixture from TASK-260 §3 (an `api`/`web` pair with an imported `deploy` plan each,
composed by a root `release` plan with a `depends_on`) as a real end-to-end test fixture, not only a
schema-level parse test, and drive it through all four scenarios TASK-260 §5 names: two-project success;
a composition-of-composition rejected before any child starts; a rollback failure that preserves the
original error; and a resumable partial state recovered by a plain re-invocation with no new flags.

Prove compatibility (TASK-260 §6): an existing local (non-composed) plan and existing imported
`project/item` invocations behave identically before and after this feature lands — run the existing
`internal/lifecycle/imported_plan_test.go` and `internal/cli/imported_plan_lifecycle_test.go` suites
unchanged and require them to still pass, rather than writing new tests that could hide a regression.

Update `USAGE.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` with the before/after configuration and invocation examples
TASK-260 §6.3 gives, and record in this card's completion evidence which independent reviewer or session
performed TASK-260 completion-criterion 6's required review (this task does not itself satisfy that
review — see TASK-260 §7 and PLAN-005's own authorship constraint: the session that wrote TASK-260 §3-§6
and PLAN-005's cards is not an independent reviewer of them).

## Completion Criteria

- [x] The two-project accepted fixture from TASK-260 §3 runs end-to-end through `up` and succeeds, with waves executed in the declared `depends_on` order | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -Eq '^func TestCompositionFixtureTwoProjectSuccess\(' internal/integration/composition_fixture_test.go && go test ./internal/integration -tags=integration -count=1`
- [x] The rejected composition-of-composition fixture from TASK-260 §3 fails validation before any child starts, with zero children reported as started | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -Eq '^func TestCompositionFixtureRejectedCycle\(' internal/integration/composition_fixture_test.go && go test ./internal/integration -tags=integration -count=1`
- [x] A rollback-failure fixture (second child fails, rollback of the first also fails) reports the original second-child error unchanged and marks the first child `rollback_failed` (TASK-260 §5.2, §5 scenario 3) | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -Eq '^func TestCompositionFixtureRollbackFailurePreservesError\(' internal/integration/composition_fixture_test.go && go test ./internal/integration -tags=integration -count=1`
- [x] A resumable-partial-state fixture re-invokes the same composition command after a rollback failure, with no new flag or persisted file, and completes successfully (TASK-260 §5.4, §5 scenario 4) | verify: `/usr/bin/grep -Eq '^func TestCompositionFixtureResumesAfterRollbackFailure\(' internal/integration/composition_fixture_test.go && go test ./internal/integration -tags=integration -count=1`
- [x] Every existing imported-plan and single-project lifecycle test (`internal/lifecycle/imported_plan_test.go`, `internal/cli/imported_plan_lifecycle_test.go`, and the full `internal/lifecycle`/`internal/cli` suites) passes unchanged, proving no regression for non-composed configurations (TASK-260 §6.1-§6.2) | verify: `go test ./internal/config ./internal/lifecycle ./internal/cli -count=1`
- [x] `USAGE.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` carry the before/after configuration and invocation examples TASK-260 §6.3 gives, and this card's completion evidence names the independent reviewer/session that performed TASK-260 completion-criterion 6's required review | verify: `make doc-check`
- [x] Repository gates pass | verify: `make lint && make test && make test-integration && make commit-check`

## Non-goals

- No new schema, resolver, runtime, or CLI behavior beyond what TASK-289 through TASK-292 already
  implement — this card verifies and documents, it does not design.
- Does not itself close TASK-260 completion-criterion 6; it only supplies the evidence an independent
  reviewer needs, and records who performed that review once it happens.

## Completion evidence

Implemented on `dev/claude/mst/feat/task293-composition-fixtures` (`5ebd07d`, `2ebc358`) by a fresh
implementer session. All four TASK-260 §5 fixtures (`internal/integration/composition_fixture_test.go`)
drive the real `internal/config`/`internal/lifecycle` APIs end-to-end (no fakes, no CLI subprocess),
proving wave/`depends_on` ordering, the rejected composition-of-composition error and zero-children-
started guarantee, rollback-failure error/state preservation, and plain-re-invocation resume — each
verified as genuinely falsifiable (not vacuous) by an independent reviewer, who additionally reproduced
each of the two hardest scenarios' failures empirically (patched the code path each test exists to
catch, confirmed the test failed as expected, then reverted).

**TASK-260 completion-criterion 6's required independent review**: performed by a separate reviewer
session (`review-task293`), not the session that authored TASK-260 §3-§6 or PLAN-005's cards. Verdict:
READY TO INTEGRATE, no blockers. Fresh gates re-run by both the reviewer and, again, independently by
the coordinator before integration: `make lint && make test && make test-integration && make
commit-check && make doc-check`, all clean.

**Bug found during implementation, out of scope here**: `internal/lifecycle/orchestrator.go`'s
`Orchestrator.Down` swallows every per-entry `plugin.Down` failure (warn + continue, unconditional
`return nil`), so `CompositionOrchestrator`'s rollback-failure detection (TASK-260 §5.2) is currently
unreachable through the real production `PlanChildExecutor.Down` — a real `dva up`'s automatic rollback
can never report `rollback_failed` for a script/process child today, though the orchestrator's own
rollback-loop logic is correct and already covered against a fake executor
(`internal/lifecycle/composition_orchestrator_test.go`). Pre-existing, not introduced by TASK-289-292,
and repo-wide (affects plain single-project `down` too) — filed separately as TASK-295, not fixed here
per this card's non-goals. The fixtures for scenarios 3/4 work around it with a test-local
`realDownExecutor` that bypasses only the swallow, documented in-line in the test file.
