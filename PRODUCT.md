# DVA (Dev Virtual Auto)

> One declarative interface for local development environments

## What is DVA?

DVA is a local-first development environment orchestrator. It combines reusable stack
declarations with named execution plans so developers can operate containers, clusters, and local
processes through one project-owned interface.

## Why?

Development environments become difficult to reproduce when commands are scattered across shell
history, Compose files, cluster tooling, Make targets, and personal setup notes.

- **Fragmented execution**: Each backend exposes different commands and lifecycle semantics.
- **Implicit knowledge**: Developers must remember file combinations, service subsets, and order.
- **Configuration drift**: Local, staging, remote, and team setups duplicate similar definitions.
- **Agent guesswork**: Coding agents cannot safely operate workflows they cannot discover.

DVA makes execution intent explicit, resolves it into a validated plan, and delegates each action
to the tool that owns the underlying resource.

## Who is it for?

| User Type | Core Need |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Application developers** | Start and inspect a complete project without memorizing backend commands |
| **Devbox and monorepo teams** | Share root orchestration while preserving subproject ownership |
| **Infrastructure-heavy projects** | Coordinate local processes, containers, and cluster tools |
| **AI coding agent users** | Discover valid project commands and effective configuration before execution |

## Key Capabilities

- **Declarative stack catalog**: Define reusable logical execution targets and their runners
- **Named execution plans**: Select targets, runner, service subset, order, and dependencies
- **Environment composition**: Apply environment, site, variables, modules, and local overrides
- **Project commands**: Expose one-shot interactions and one-time provisioning procedures
- **Validation and diagnostics**: Validate schema and semantics, inspect effective configuration,
  and diagnose prerequisites
- **Machine-readable discovery**: Publish commands and resolved configuration for coding agents
- **Subproject composition**: Import active child projects without taking ownership of their native commands
- **Portable skill installation**: Install bundled AI skills into runtime directories
  (`dva skill install|status|uninstall|backup`) with per-skill ownership claims, collision
  rejection for unowned files, and recoverable takeover backups behind explicit runtime selection

## Product Boundaries

DVA targets local development and maintenance work, including explicit invocation and
observation of repository-owned artifact build, publication, and verification jobs. It is not
a production operations or application deployment tool.

- Local virtual environments are the default execution target. Declare a remote target
  only for a resource that cannot run locally, such as a shared database or a managed
  service.
- Remote access carries development or maintenance intent. Repository-owned artifact jobs
  retain their build and publication logic; DVA owns explicit invocation, tracking, and result
  verification. Artifact promotion, application deployment, rollout, rollback, incident
  response, and production operations remain outside its model.
- `environments` names such as `stg` and `prd` label which variable set a plan resolves.
  They are not permission to operate that environment from DVA.
- Custom configuration can reach past this boundary. Generated configuration —
  `dva init` scaffolds, skills, and agent flows — stays inside it.

DVA coordinates existing developer tools; it does not replace them.

- Compose, Kubernetes, Helm, and process tools retain ownership of their native resources.
- DVA does not hide destructive lifecycle operations behind implicit automation.
- Provisioning is for one-time preparation; repeatable startup belongs to execution plans.
- Project secrets remain outside shared declarative configuration. Named secret transfers
  declare encrypted sources, selected keys, and destinations; plaintext values are never
  configuration fields. See [remote artifact jobs](docs/62-remote-artifact-jobs.md).
- AI-assisted improvement is optional and must preserve the same validation and ownership rules.

## Current Status

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| **Maturity** | Active development — named plans are the only application lifecycle surface; the legacy `stack`/`app`/`infra`/`clean` CLI verbs were removed, while `stack:` and `infra:` remain declarative config sections ([docs/43](docs/43-command-surface-restructure.md)). `dva ssh` separately manages the workspace SSH helper container. |
| **Primary interface** | `dva` CLI with project-owned `dva.yml` |
| **Execution model** | Reusable declarations resolved into immutable named plans |
| **Agent integration** | Machine-readable manifest plus optional Claude and agent-mesh workflows |
